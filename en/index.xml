&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching The Line, the incredible project that Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented a couple of years ago as he showed his vision of the future of Saudi Arabia. When I decided to write this piece, I had an idea in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wealthy must be building their little oasis for when climate change finally leaves us all with an unlivable planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after quite a bit of reading, I think they just don&amp;rsquo;t know what the f**k they are doing. I guess they don’t know that you can’t breathe dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about it, here is the official advertisement. As you can see, they have spent a lot of effort on it. It is worth watching, even if you think of it as a science-fiction short film. But bare in mind this is just a simulation. None of it is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kz5vEqdaSc&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;video-source-neomcomhttpswwwneomcomen-usregionstheline&#34;&gt;Video source: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.neom.com/en-us/regions/theline&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;neom.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Neom project is part of &lt;strong&gt;Saudi Arabia&amp;rsquo;s 2030 vision&lt;/strong&gt;. In the last few years, the country has developed in many ways. They have given women some of our beloved rights allowing us to drive and paying us equal salaries for equal work. They also have invested in education and technology. It&amp;rsquo;s as if Prince Mohammed wanted to say: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saudi Arabia is open for international business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Which I hope happens and affects the population in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This huge city, planned to accommodate 9 million people, is supposed to be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; future. However, according to many engineers, architects and strategists, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;not realistic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-we-have-the-required-technology-to-run-it&#34;&gt;Do we have the required technology to run it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neom promises a transportation system that can travel &lt;strong&gt;170km in twenty minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. Japan is still building the fastest train we&amp;rsquo;ve seen, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even qualify for Neom&amp;rsquo;s requirements. In fact, Japan has trouble getting it to term, and they don&amp;rsquo;t expect to have it ready until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue comes when you look at the &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; supply. The available &lt;strong&gt;desalination&lt;/strong&gt; options are not very efficient, and the alternative designs are in the early stages of development and won&amp;rsquo;t be a reality by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation means that Neom would have to release millions of tons of CO2/year into the atmosphere and a bunch of litters of brine water into the sea, messing up the oxygen levels and, therefore, the marine life. So much for their zero-carbon marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the structure itself. &lt;strong&gt;Five hundred meters tall walls and separated by a 200 meters gap?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I the only one who feels &lt;strong&gt;claustrophobic&lt;/strong&gt; only thinking about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is the air going to flow if the outer environment is overheated by mirror glass walls? We don&amp;rsquo;t want another pandemic in those circumstances. I guess they expect to spend even more energy on air-con than we already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also promised fresh air and plenty of vegetation as if it were an easy task in those conditions, but there is no real plan to get natural sunlight inside the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok! You are right! Technology evolves fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they solve all those issues in a revolutionary way that brings abundance to the nation. But that is exactly what it&amp;rsquo;s being done in many other projects that entail much less risk than The Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-it-really-preserve-the-surroundings&#34;&gt;Does it really preserve the surroundings?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;95% of land will be preserved for nature&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. It is true that due to its narrow design, the soil surface used for building might correspond to only 5% of the land. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that its construction won&amp;rsquo;t have any &lt;strong&gt;repercussions on the natural surroundings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the linear concept creates a fragmentation of natural habits. Along the highway, you probably have seen some &lt;strong&gt;wildlife corridors&lt;/strong&gt; placed to allow animal migration. This is an indispensable feature for an environmentally friendly layout, one that The Line lacks from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neom might be located in a dry ecosystem, but in a desert, there are still thousands of species that will be affected by this giant obstacle. The issue is not only about animals being unable to travel; it&amp;rsquo;s about biodiversity, about inbreeding and genetic mutations that can lead to the deterioration of the species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of that without mentioning the walls that will for sure be a massive trap to birds. Already glassy skyscrapers have shown their devastating influence on them; I cannot imagine 170 km of a continuous mirror barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of it, we have to think if building &lt;strong&gt;a city from scratch&lt;/strong&gt; can actually be more &lt;strong&gt;sustainable&lt;/strong&gt; than improving what we already have. Right in Saudi Arabia, we have many examples of disproportionately construction works that didn&amp;rsquo;t lead to anything positive. Much territory was stolen from the sea with the intention of building man-made islands that would function as holiday resorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot begin to tell you how terribly it has impacted marine life. If it had at least a reasonable purpose, we could weigh the consequences, but the reality is that very little of the new ground was eventually used at all. It only served one goal shared only by a reduced proportion of the country&amp;rsquo;s population: &lt;em&gt;to create more capital for those who already have it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-going-to-live-there&#34;&gt;Who is going to live there?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a city is a place where large amounts of people live, this is the most relevant question of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a start, the government is &lt;strong&gt;pushing people out of their land&lt;/strong&gt;. Entire tribes have to relocate, God knows where. There has yet to be a plan for their relocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they going to get a nice spot in the future Neom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that case, is it fair to force someone to live in a totally different way than they&amp;rsquo;ve always had?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their marketing campaign, they insist that old cities are designed around industries and that The line is tailored to prioritize humans over anything else. Correct me if I am wrong, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like they have put much thought into &lt;strong&gt;their fellow countryman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it has an explanation: the project is expected to cost over 1$ trillion! The government can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;afford&lt;/strong&gt; it, so they are left with only one option. They need investors, rich people who want a part in it, maybe an apartment in a promising exotic town in which they can relax for a couple of weeks, oblivious to the reality of the world. A world in which most people can&amp;rsquo;t afford a house and struggle to pay rent. I don&amp;rsquo;t know nor understand their plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do know is that they certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t found anyone to inhabit Dubai&amp;rsquo;s man-made islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-price-mohammed-bin-salmans-political-agenda&#34;&gt;What is Price Mohammed bin Salman&amp;rsquo;s political agenda?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After questioning and refuting their architectural and environmental arguments, I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a good reason to initiate the project as it is, other than &lt;strong&gt;attention&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have mentioned the Prince&amp;rsquo;s aspirations of building the modern pyramid of Giza, something to leave behind that will keep his name in the history books. I think that even though it is a plausible idea, there has to be something else underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do agree with the fact that this endeavour is attracting quite some attention and that it is an efficient way of marketing the country. In the end, we are mentioning the nation&amp;rsquo;s name more often than we would otherwise. But it seems rather excessive to give the go-ahead to such an expensive project without any special purpose in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-kind-of-economic-activities-will-there-be&#34;&gt;What kind of economic activities will there be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most frequent complaints about its feasibility is that in order to get people to go and live there, there has to be some sort of economic activity going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that we are talking about a modular city in the middle of the desert, we are facing a lack of interest and motivation for the initial residents. The reason why technological cities grow none stop is that companies want to be where other companies are. In other words, they seek an already existent business fabric that enables them to improve production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand this is what they are hoping for, but they are not giving any details about how they plan to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make it more appealing, it looks like they want to create Neom as a “&lt;strong&gt;city-state&lt;/strong&gt;”, that is to say, a city with its own laws and tax system. They are talking about a free trade zone. In that case, people wouldn’t live in the city; they would come for a few days for business and then go. That is why there put a lot of emphasis on the recent airport build in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this possibility, the city will be totally independent of Saudi Arabia’s government, though it would still be part of the country, and it would have certain financial advantages for those internationals that want to do business. All of it without having to adapt to the Arabic culture while quite likely being served by lower-class Saudis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds very much like a &lt;strong&gt;tax haven&lt;/strong&gt;, and I doubt very much that the average population of the country will gain much from it. Why do they have to leave their culture behind if we are talking about their future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-are-the-locals-who-disagree&#34;&gt;Where are the locals who disagree?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time of Neom&amp;rsquo;s introduction to the world, Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who dared to criticize the development of this city, disappeared and, later, he was found dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different countries investigated the matter getting to the conclusion that the murder must have been ordered by the Prince. As often happens in these cases, it is difficult to find justice further than those who directly committed the crime. Nevertheless, it points out how much this project meant for Saudi Arabia&amp;rsquo;s royalty and how little is still the freedom of speech for those who disagree with their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-he-trust-the-untrustworthy&#34;&gt;Why does he trust the untrustworthy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point, even if most aspects of the project were quite fishy, I was ready to give them the benefit of the doubt. But then I came across their &lt;strong&gt;experts&lt;/strong&gt;. On their official website, they show who is in charge of management and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I am too naive, but I was expecting them to put this project into their own people&amp;rsquo;s hands. They talked so much about their country&amp;rsquo;s future that I thought the logical thing to do was to rely on them, Saudis who know the land and understand the needs of their own population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what I found were ex-pats from America or even Australia. And, to my surprise, a Spanish Chief Urban Planning Officer. I am Spanish myself, so when I saw his name (Antonie Vives) I was very intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site provided a small background about them in which it was mentioned he was the Former Deputy of Barcelona. Then, my scepticism pushed me to research his profile to satisfy my curiosity and also to understand a bit more about the spirit of this design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is very well known in the Catalonian Region, but not for good reasons. Only last year, he was sentenced to two years in prison for &lt;strong&gt;corruption&lt;/strong&gt;, later reduced to six months of community service. During his time in Barcelona&amp;rsquo;s city council, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/es/Antoni_Vives_i_Tom%C3%A0s&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Antoni Vives&lt;/a&gt; defrauded the sum of 155.067 euros. He has also been linked to at least &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://english.elpais.com/politics/catalonia_independence/2020-08-06/catalonias-3-case-brings-political-and-business-leaders-close-to-trial.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;another case of corruption&lt;/a&gt; that is &lt;strong&gt;currently&lt;/strong&gt; under investigation in the courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think this is the right man for the job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the Prince&amp;rsquo;s intentions with the Neom project are, but I do know he is taking some high risks here. If he plays well his cards he might make some pocket money for himself but, what’s a prince without his kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an interview with Aljazeera, Journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in relationship to the 1$ trillion costs of the project, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if it goes wrong? It could bankrupt the country! And no one is allowed to criticise it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Mohammed bin Salma has trusted the future of his nation to very unreliable businessmen who won&amp;rsquo;t blink an eye if they see the opportunity to fill their pockets with dirty money and fly away to the next county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prince might not lose his money, but he might lose his country. &lt;strong&gt;And who is going to lose the most are the Saudis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where is freedom?</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/whereisfreedom/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A poem about searching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in the morning, I just want to run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;far from these daunting feelings of dark clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to visit everybody&amp;rsquo;s mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because I am seeking the knowledge of the Freeman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, a familiar odour pushes me to recall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that there is no such info. There is none!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all doubt every day and every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no certainty, we start to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faster. Faster and light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kilometre after a mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water from my forehead travelling south&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stops still at my empty dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each drop of effort makes me understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that running doesn&amp;rsquo;t help you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you are circling around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is no place, no mood or phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is a utopia. That&amp;rsquo;s my guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-ordered-a-new-phone-case-he-slept-on-the-sideroad&#34;&gt;I ordered a new phone case. He slept on the sideroad.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just passed Black Friday and any other excuse for excessive consumption before Christmas crazy spending. Usually, I am all against this kind of event. I am the kind of person everybody hates because I keep reminding others that capitalism makes us miserable and unhappy. That we should focus on people and reduce our attachment to things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year, I just forgot all about it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning to make any particular purchases, and the whole &amp;ldquo;special offers thing&amp;rdquo; just slipped my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;em&gt;AdBlock&lt;/em&gt; in my browser to avoid advertisements as much as possible. Some webs don&amp;rsquo;t allow it, but for the most part, it works pretty well. Mainly, I am not the victim of aggressive marketing. I still have to swallow a few ads, of course. I did hear of the coming Black Friday; I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know on which days it fell this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a bit of context, a few months ago, I noticed my phone was freezing increasingly often. This is a long story that I am going to make short by saying that I ended up buying a new phone case. For me, the moment I bought it was just any day, but it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the order only a few days before I left for a long trip. I was driving from the Netherlands to Spain, and of course, I wanted to have my new phone case. I was a bit disappointed to see that the expected arrival day was the same day I was leaving. Actually, it could be that day or two days later. Anyway, right before I got into my car, I checked the mail, and there it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I bought the damned phone case on Black Friday week. A phone case might seem like &lt;strong&gt;a small detail&lt;/strong&gt;, but it felt &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; when &lt;strong&gt;later&lt;/strong&gt; I witness the struggles of those in charge of delivering my little acquisition with my own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We buy plenty of things all year round. We do it as often as our pockets allow it and as much as our desires demand it. More often than not, those things are our emotions bottled up into impulses and transformed into objects that are supposed to bring us happiness. And if we dare to question it, we have plenty of excuses to confront any remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I deserve it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s only a few bucks!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was cheaper, and I needed it anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we left home for our trip, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thinking about that. I was more worried about the affairs of long travels. We were driving nearby Paris when we had to decide where to spend the night. We have a small van, and we resolved to save some money and sleep in it, even though winter is the worst time for such an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking for a nice spot, I started to pay attention to other people on the road. There was no other van. A few cars pass by, probably stopping for a coffee in order to stay alert during their last driving hour. And then, a thousand trucks. It was full of trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had made this trip before, so I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised by it, &lt;strong&gt;should I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was something different. I am not talking about parking lots full of trucks. I am talking about &lt;strong&gt;truck drivers sleeping beside the highway&lt;/strong&gt;, right on the roadside, nearly touching the hard shoulder. And it was not an eccentric and patientless driver. No. It was one truck after the other. Quite a few kilometres of professional drivers unable to find a parking lot where to spend the night. Now, parked without a bathroom or a warm cup of tea. All of it so I could have a new phone case for my trip to Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, the proud woman full of principles, was a participant in their exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had gotten something clear out of all of this, but the truth is: I ignore how to do better. I am trying to figure out how to fight against these injustices without adding to them, but no answers have come to me. Only one question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we left so powerless that we can&amp;rsquo;t avoid hurting the weakest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;look-around-and-youll-see&#34;&gt;Look around, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think of a family, we often picture the same structure: mother, father, little boy and tiny girl. It&amp;rsquo;s sad, but for most of us, that&amp;rsquo;s how our brain is wired, and I am not talking in a biological sense; I am talking in an ideological sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to start by saying that capitalism has offered many things to humanity; there is no questioning that. We also sense, or know, that its time has come to an end. And as usually happens in the final chapters, we are here to reflect on the past and learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family is a construct that bends according to culture. &lt;em&gt;Capitalist lifestyle is a culture so well spread that we don&amp;rsquo;t even notice how far its impact goes.&lt;/em&gt; We get our traditions confused with it because the economic system adapts to any beliefs turning them into products, and we are happy they look good on us. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we have done with our families; we &amp;ldquo;build&amp;rdquo; them to look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not why capitalism broke &amp;ldquo;the family&amp;rdquo;. It goes beyond that. It is not only a matter of looks, not even a matter of status. It is a matter of control. Before the last feminist revolution, we were infused with the idea that women should stay home taking care of the house and delivering babies to fuel the working force. We stopped questioning it, mainly because the &lt;strong&gt;materialistic&lt;/strong&gt; standard of living was improving for everyone. Yes, maybe thanks to destroying the planet and creating huge future debt, but it seemed to improve consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until now, people didn&amp;rsquo;t really have to ask themselves what their future would be like.&lt;/strong&gt; Work was always available, and labour was fairly paid. The salary of one man could support a family with three or four children easily. &lt;strong&gt;We were told that every generation would live better and better, and we believed it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it sounds almost crazy, but before, we had a world where companies needed an increment of the labour force so badly that they paid enough to feed a decent family. &lt;strong&gt;Did you ever wonder why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, the world population had much smaller numbers. The industries were growing, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the advantages of our present technology, so men&amp;rsquo;s power was really important to have. They could have &lt;strong&gt;exploited their workers&lt;/strong&gt; like they do now and like they did before with &lt;strong&gt;plain slavery&lt;/strong&gt;, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t look good, especially when you are criticizing communism and other government systems. Also, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t help in the situation they were in. In addition, the demand was high, so the profits came easily as long as they had people working. The wheel was spinning fast and furious. Companies didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about many regulations because, at that time, very few people cared about the climate, which also added to their financial gain. You can say they could afford to pay good salaries, and not only that, they needed employees to be &lt;strong&gt;overproductive&lt;/strong&gt; because they didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough workers to fulfil their future projections. To motivate their workforce to perform more and better and even more to the point of exhaustion, the powerful class introduced &lt;strong&gt;the culture of effort&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you go the extra mile, you&amp;rsquo;ll get the extra dime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally, companies through money to their problem, the shortage of manpower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period it&amp;rsquo;s when today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;manufactured&lt;/em&gt; idea of a family came into play. The fast-growing industry was craving more heads, more hands, more legs; more bodies to build the modern version of the Egyptian pyramids. Women were then encouraged to stay at home, both to show their husbands were able to support their families and to take care of their springs. Even though contraceptive methods were already available, they were not widely used. Having many children was a blessing. More hands to work! About this time it is when the housewife term was &amp;ldquo;invented&amp;rdquo;. These wives were at home all the time, and any activity they did, according to society, should be related to their homes. But it is not like these women weren&amp;rsquo;t doing any work for the industry (and society). They were actually doing the most important one. &lt;strong&gt;Women were literally creating the substitution of the always exhausted workforce.&lt;/strong&gt; They were educating them about the capitalist system, just like the upper class needed them to do. And the best thing of all, they were doing this job at no cost to the owners of the industry. &lt;strong&gt;The reproductive labour, the caring labour, and the education labour were totally free.&lt;/strong&gt; So much it was that we stopped to consider it a job altogether. As if looking after someone supposes no effort, as if the physical work put into creating a life and breastfeeding had no meaning in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. People were happy enough in economic terms because the men were getting enough money to cover all the expenses and therefore, women were &amp;ldquo;indirectly&amp;rdquo; paid. Of course, this meant that many women started to suffer financial abuse, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the main subject of this article. The perfect family had a hardworking husband, a loving wife, and at least one smart boy and a pretty girl. The couple would become independent from their parents as soon as they got married because, back then, you could easily afford a house. Capitalism had created the perfect family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perfect family was never perfect. Maybe from a &lt;strong&gt;materialistic&lt;/strong&gt; point of view, it was. But when we approach it from an &lt;strong&gt;emotional&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;mental&lt;/strong&gt; perspective, we find many issues. Domestic violence was highly common, LGBT people were pushed out of society as they weren&amp;rsquo;t able to create their own perfect family, working women were seen as odd and unworthy, a single mum couldn&amp;rsquo;t access well-paid jobs… But leaving this crucial matter aside, those who fell into the &amp;ldquo;perfect family&amp;rdquo; structure had quite a gracious life. Why don&amp;rsquo;t we have it nowadays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, not even the whole salary of two people is enough to support a family. We are asked to give 200% at our jobs as if the future of the company had anything to do with our personal future. We complain and demand dignity for everybody, but as a result, we are told that we are &lt;strong&gt;lazy&lt;/strong&gt; because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend our lives working to destroy a planet that already sees us as a &lt;strong&gt;plague&lt;/strong&gt;. When women were going out of their homes to work, we were told that it would make them free. They were joining the workforce to be at the same level as men. What actually happened is that the average salary started to decrease as the total number of the workforce increased. Women remained in charge of reproductive labour, but they also had to handle a regular job, often worse paid than men. No compensation for agreeing to put your body through pregnancy and delivery, nor for taking care of the dependent members of the family. &lt;strong&gt;Did you know that pregnancy can shorten a woman&amp;rsquo;s lifespan?&lt;/strong&gt; A soldier goes to war, and since it is a risky situation, they get extra paid for that. A miner who works extracting toxic materials gets health compensation. But &lt;strong&gt;women creating the future workforce are punished&lt;/strong&gt; because they need time to recover from labour and to comply with breastfeeding. Note that delivering a baby is called labour, though it is not financially compensated by society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both men and women, members of the working class, are feeling powerless towards the notion of creating a family simply because the idea seems like a titanic project. If you want to have, not only the time to be with your child, but the energy, too, you are left with no options. &lt;strong&gt;Women need to fulfil their intellectual passions, so the answer doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from sacrificing our freedom.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t often see men willing to stay at home to care for their children, but even those that would like to do it don&amp;rsquo;t have the opportunity as we still require at least two salaries to raise a child. Elon Musk can criticize the common people for not having children. I understand his point of view as a businessman. However, deliberately having them without the means and time to give them is reckless and egoistic. Here, of course, I am not counting those people who unexpectedly see themselves facing pregnancy and have to make a subjective decision. That is a moral question that each of us should answer independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of this difficult milieu, people are isolating themselves as their lives only spin around work in order to survive, which leaves them with no energy to invest in a relationship. Many women are so afraid of being financially abused like their mothers or simply losing their freedom that they fear men altogether. Men have always been isolated within themselves, unable to share any discomforting feelings, and now, with the level of competition that we find in the labour market, even friendship seems controversial. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many times I heard, even used, the famous quote that says: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;We are born alone, we live alone, and we die alone.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; We usually say it as justification for disappointment after our heart has been broken by a lover or a friend. We forget that Orson Welles&amp;rsquo;s quote didn&amp;rsquo;t end there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we’re not alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belonging might be an illusion, but since our minds are no reality, loneliness is an illusion too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A family is often the easiest way of getting that belonging feeling, an accessible reason for happiness. Though with the current challenges youth is facing, a family it&amp;rsquo;s now a responsibility that we are not ready to take. &lt;strong&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t ready, not because we are not brave.&lt;/strong&gt; We are not ready because we have no stability at all. Nor economically, socially, mentally, or environmentally. Even in old rich countries like European ones, we are relying upon the cruel and vice decisions of a few delusional men. &lt;strong&gt;If you want to get depressed in no time, listen to a political scientist or an expert in geopolitics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the later generations have only one hope for happiness. People need to start thinking about other family options, other forms of social organization and community. This means that we are going to have to challenge the system as this &amp;ldquo;manufactured family&amp;rdquo; is the base of the current system. The are many questions to answer, like who are we going to manage the inheritance of capital. Though I believe we have greater problems than the obstacles that a new type of family can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are fair, the future has no relevance in our current life because we lack any &lt;strong&gt;interventional power&lt;/strong&gt; over it. Of course, we can concern ourselves with it in a political way, but in our daily lives, it makes no sense to think much about it. We are left with the present, which is actually quite a nice gift. But we have to learn to unwrap it and enjoy it. Human beings need relationships based on &lt;strong&gt;emotional connection&lt;/strong&gt;, not only acquaintances that you wave at in the street. Not those colleagues with who you talk politely but only about the weather. Real human connections that only a family can provide. The good news is that, as I said before, family is a construct, &lt;strong&gt;a concept that is uniquely subjected to yourself&lt;/strong&gt;. A family doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to involve a husband or a wife or even children. Frequently, it is integrated by friends. A family can be only one person who makes you feel comfortable with yourself. A family only entails love and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you dare to disappoint capitalism?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you dare to design your own &amp;ldquo;perfect family&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you dare to confront social uniformity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And if so, what is your master plan?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are you middle class? You don&#39;t want any tax increase, huh!? Are you sure?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2222.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Are you middle class? You don&#39;t want any tax increase, huh!? Are you sure?" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-the-wolf-gives-advice-to-the-sheep&#34;&gt;When the wolf gives advice to the sheep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blogs.publico.es/juantorres/2022/10/13/la-patronal-lleva-razon-si-hablamos-de-ricos-y-pobres-se-va-a-liar/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;At the beginning of this month&lt;/a&gt;, The Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations (CEOE) &lt;em&gt;advised the media not to talk about in terms of rich and poor because it could create social instability&lt;/em&gt;. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more. Given the current socioeconomic situation, if you allow people to think about where they stand, you risk getting them upset. I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to get anybody upset. So I am going to stay neutral and start talking about the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wonder. &lt;strong&gt;Who is the middle class?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you search for a concept, you often find many definitions, but in most cases, these definitions differ in only small details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the case of the middle class, we can see how its definition has changed a great deal over time. If we think of it as the middle point between the upper and the lower classes, we end up with many questions. The upper class are those who don&amp;rsquo;t need to work as they own a fair amount of capital and they hold property of production means which are run by employees. In contraposition, the lower class needs to sell their labour power in order to get the minimum capital required to survive. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is called the working class. So, as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Marx and Engels&lt;/a&gt; defined, and so anybody that knows how to draw the middle point on a line, it is wise to assume that the middle class are those who own the bare minimum property of production means, but they are still required to work as to keep it generating capital. I would like to put some emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;owning the production means&lt;/strong&gt; because this particularity makes a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching to gather an impression of what nowadays is understood as the middle class, I opened an &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middle-class.asp&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Investopedia&lt;/em&gt; (the standard website for many people interested in finance) in which &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/contributors/53677/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Adam Hayes&lt;/a&gt; offers a completely different definition. I could do nothing but become incensed. Here is a portion of their explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-class families tend to own their own home (although with a mortgage), own a car (although with a loan or lease), send their kids to college (although with student loans or scholarships), are saving for retirement, and have enough disposable savings to afford certain luxuries like dining out and vacations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle class families tend to own their own home (although with a mortgage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct me if I am wrong, but paying for a &lt;strong&gt;mortgage&lt;/strong&gt; is not the same as owning a house. It might be better than paying rent, but it definitely means that you &lt;strong&gt;do not own&lt;/strong&gt; a house yet. And as far as I know, having an adequate roof over our heads is nothing more than a sign of a decent and dignified life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;own a car (although with a loan or lease)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A car is often a requirement to work. If they want to make money, many people are bound to use one. Both in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://nltimes.nl/2022/08/09/used-car-prices-starting-fall-first-time-year#:~:text=In%20July%2C%20the%20platform%20sold,in%20the%20spring%20of%202021.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/274928/used-vehicle-average-selling-price-in-the-united-states/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;America&lt;/a&gt;, the average price for used vehicles is slightly above 20,000 euros/dollars. Does it make sense that a middle-class citizen needs a loan to pay for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;send their kids to college (although with student loans or scholarships)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education is not an extra; it is not some hobby. An educated society is less violent. Educated citizens are the ones who fight against pandemics or create amazing technology. A university loan is a mortgage for the student. A scholarship is a reward for the student&amp;rsquo;s excellence. None of them is a direct perk of the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are saving for retirement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have in their mind to save for retirement? I will tell you who. Those who need to pay a mortgage, a car lease and a student loan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and have enough disposable savings to afford certain luxuries like dining out and vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, getting pizza every Friday and going to the beach for a week in summer are luxuries. Who needs a break? Certainly not human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his definition of the middle class, Hayes doesn&amp;rsquo;t even mention the means of production, which are the most important pillar when it comes to talking about social structure. If you don&amp;rsquo;t own your house, you don&amp;rsquo;t own your workshop, you don&amp;rsquo;t own your car, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have money (capital) to invest in your children&amp;rsquo;s education, are you really anywhere near the middle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Global_Wealth_Distribution_2020_%28Property%29.svg&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Global shareholders of wealth by wealth group, Credit Suisse, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this graphic, we take that 11% of the population has more than $100k in property, and therefore they are middle class. But I wonder, where do you find a house that costs about $100K? Which factory or shop can you afford? Who can actually own anything if you don&amp;rsquo;t have at least up to $250K? The minimum required to belong in the middle class, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be, at least, the amount needed to purchase a house? How far would that 11% shrink? 5%? 6%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the middle class was supposed to be a group of people that don&amp;rsquo;t live surrounded by gold but do have real financial security. This is a situation in which you can take a health break and not panic because you and your family will struggle. Otherwise, what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between a middle-class and a working-class citizen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The difference is becoming more subtle every day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a middle-class citizen, you might think that most of your interests lie right next to the upper class. You might think that if you were to pay fewer taxes, you would be able to save more money and eventually go up the ladder a few steps. Many people think that way. Many people vote for politicians who claim lowering taxes will solve our issues. And it would be an appealing idea if it only it was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last decades, the USA has predominately followed a philosophy of tax resistance. It is not surprising that there is not much of a safety net for regular citizens. In the European continent, taxes are much higher, and so are the social benefits applied to vulnerable citizens. In any case, the discussion about taxation is a popular subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/sep/27/super-rich-uk-non-doms-avoiding-32bn-in-tax-each-year-report-finds&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;In the UK&lt;/a&gt;, they have recently been juggling with it. First, reducing the tax requirement for the super-rich overseas people on the bases of attracting more wealthy people to the country. As anticipated by the sceptical, the UK government lost £3.2bn in annual tax revenue. Then, when it struggled to meet its obligations, the government retreated to its previous tax rules. Only the super-rich (1%) benefited: big companies with already enough capital and power. The middle class and other ordinary taxpayers saw how their welfare state deteriorated while the energy bill and groceries became dangerously unaffordable. After witnessing this embarrassing performance, UK&amp;rsquo;s economy has lost reliability and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businessinsider.com/spain-wealth-solidarity-tax-rich-soaring-inflation-money-assets-levy-2022-9?international=true&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;On the other side of the coin&lt;/a&gt; is Spain; the Budget Minister recently announced new tax rules for 2023. In this case, the tax cuts will favour small businesses, the self-employed, and workers earning less than €21,000 ($20,490) a year. It directly affects 1.344.000 ordinary taxpayers, people who are struggling with the burdens of inflation and the energy crisis. These measures will lift some of that weight off their shoulders. The government will have the capacity to afford it thanks to the implementation of a “solidarity tax” on people with assets worth at least €3 million. The new tax disturbs only 23,000 citizens (0.1% of the population) and has the potential to collect €1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businesseurope.eu/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;BussinesEurope&lt;/a&gt; (the European employers’ association) seems to be so concerned with the new taxation that they had to send a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.businesseurope.eu/sites/buseur/files/media/public_letters/ecofin/2022-08-31_mbe-z.stanjura_-_extraordinary_tax_measures.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to some members of the European Government. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The class war never ends, the masters never relent.” — Noah Chomsky&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is because they worry about the middle class, much less about the working class. A good deal of the people from BussinessEurope and the CEOE belong to the 1% shown in the bar chart previously displayed, and they are not to be trusted when it comes to standard citizens&amp;rsquo; interests. As I said earlier, if you identify as a middle-class citizen, you might think your interests are aligned with theirs, but I hope you can now see that lowering taxes is not always to your benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often hear the freedom argument. &amp;ldquo;Taxes are restrictions and, therefore, reduce my liberty.&amp;rdquo; If you truly want to be free, you need a state to protect you. An organization that watches for justice and provides for your weakest moments. Without a funded state, we are not living in freedom we are living in the jungle, where the strongest (the rich) will do whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation of climate change is a clear example. The average taxpayer can&amp;rsquo;t do much about it. Only a big organization can make the big changes we need. But, if that big organization is private and has private interests, it is not going to find the motivation to care about the environment. They are going to keep polluting because it is indeed profitable. They are going to keep destroying the Earth because they have already built their little oasis where only a few will be safe. For that, we need the state, &lt;strong&gt;a well-funded state that can protect the common interest of the public&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the base of a pyramid is robust, you have more chances to keep your status. The middle class is disappearing by the minute, and the working class is turning into plain poor. Think about it. If you were to slip and fall or even be pushed down, rising from the solid ground is much easier than emerging from shifting sands. Tax contributions are the stones that build our future. At the moment, our future is owned by a few, and none of them is middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.&amp;rdquo; ― Ursula K. Le Guin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations (CEOE) doesn&amp;rsquo;t want us to talk about the rich and the poor because it wants people to believe they can become part of the middle class and have a comfortable future. Actually, the middle class is on the brink of extinction, and the lower class is confronting harsher living conditions. Those with economic power want us to dream we can become them because while we do so, we don&amp;rsquo;t bother them. But we are far away from them, and we will be even further if we don&amp;rsquo;t force them to pay higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s make them pay taxes for all the damage they&amp;rsquo;ve done in the name of profit. Furthermore, they have plenty of money to get out and go to space. So, as Trump says: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If they don&amp;rsquo;t like it here, they can leave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn the radio off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and put your boots on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&amp;rsquo;ve got a new goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross the threshold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with courage, be strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek the treasures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hidden in the new world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a land or a job;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s a new way of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the difficult questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are the measurement of worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As necessary, you can be wrong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as there&amp;rsquo;s no punishment of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is not bold,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nor it&amp;rsquo;s easy to be told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth wants to be found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by you and you alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is much more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;than what you see in your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, it is your core,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what we call your world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you must know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that facts have no purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gravity lets you fall,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it went rogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means you forgot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that precious hoards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;are often buried on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you meet the hard soil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t think you have lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep searching a bit more,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and don&amp;rsquo;t lose any hope.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Jesus a fictional character?</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/is_jesus_fictional/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am well aware of the sorrow that emerges from a belief crashing inside you. Cognitive dissonance is one of the most unpleasant experiences for the human mind. For the human body, even. Hopefully, this article won&amp;rsquo;t create any pain for anyone, though I have the feeling it will certainly itch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Emperor Constantine, in the year 303, assembled a small redaction team and commissioned them to write the four Gospel and several other texts, all of them falsified, in order to implant his new religion throughout the Roman Empire, Christianity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might sound nuts, but there is proof this is what happened. Fernando Conde Torrens spent 20 years researching the existence of Jesus before he, in 2016, finally put all the clues together in his last book &lt;em&gt;Año 303. Inventan el Cristianismo (Year 303. Invention of Christianity).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conde Torrens was 40 years old when he suffered a crisis of faith in the Church and felt the need to dig deeper. He is no atheist; he is a believer with great curiosity and greater respect for God. Conde Torrens started this journey only by trying to learn more so he could put in place all the irony and double standards he witnessed in Christianity. To do so, he learned Greek and Hebrew, which allowed him to directly read the ancient texts without intermediaries that could potentially edulcorate the content. After all this effort, he eventually got to the bottom of it: Jesus is a fictional character, and Christianity is an invented religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Fernando-Conde-Torrens/dp/8493291935&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;book&lt;/a&gt; provides irrefutable documentary evidence present in the texts themselves (the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, John and various other writings of the New Testament), which show that all of them are the work of the same person, one of the members of the writing team assembled by Constantine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;picture-of-the-testimonium-flavianum-in-wikipedia&#34;&gt;Picture of the Testimonium Flavianum in Wikipedia&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you are a well-read Christian, you are probably thinking about Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian who supposedly wrote about Jesus&amp;rsquo; crucifixion following his description of Pontius Pilate. Here is the passage that Josephus supposedly wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Christ. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared. (18.3., transl. by Louis H. Feldman)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, both historians and theologians reason that this passage has been subsequently added with the intention of validating Christian beliefs. First of all, because if Jesus had existed, his contemporary followers would have written about him and his teachings, as happened with Socrates, and not 60 years later based on what Flavio had heard around. Another argument is that Josephus was not only Jew but very involved with his faith. Therefore, he would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah. Also, the explicit inclusion of Christian phraseology, which was slowly developed through the years, highly suggests the presence of some interpolations (alterations). In other words, someone felt the need to alter the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people still hold onto the hope that even if the writing was altered, Josephus originally meant to mention Jesus anyway, and so they call it a partially original &lt;em&gt;Testimonium&lt;/em&gt;. But they don&amp;rsquo;t really have any proof to believe in such a thing. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/8139663/_Was_the_Hypothetical_Vorlage_of_the_Testimonium_Flavianum_a_Neutral_Text_Challenging_the_Common_Wisdom_on_Antiquitates_Judaicae_18_63_64_Journal_for_the_Study_of_Judaism_45_2014_326_365&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;In fact&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like this paragraph is cutting halfway through a passage, separating it into two fragments that otherwise would have a perfect union with each other. The &lt;em&gt;Testimonium Flavianum&lt;/em&gt; is merely a paragraph that was written totally out of context, while a historical text was copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Fernando Conde&amp;rsquo;s studies, Flavius Josephus wrote his Judaic Antiquities without citing Jesus Christ at all. About two hundred years later, Constantine formed a team made up of Lactantius and Eusebius of Cesarea, who was a historian. As their intention was to generate proof to support their new &amp;ldquo;religion of the Empire&amp;rdquo;, Eusebio changed Flavius Josephus&amp;rsquo;s text to put a piece in which he quoted Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that Lactantius and Eusebius were Constantine&amp;rsquo;s acquaintances, but they were very different to each other. Eusebius was a very reflexive man, very interested in philosophy-like thinking. On the other hand, Lactantius, who lived through a rough time in the Roman Empire, was convinced that the world was getting to an end. It appears he showed this ideology in his book &lt;em&gt;The Divine Institutes,&lt;/em&gt; and it is by studying his work that Conde Torrens realized he had an essential role in developing the Christian imaginary. Lactantius was obsessed with miracles, the creation of the Church and hell as a punishment. He appeared to be a very repressed man, and so he also was very fond of criticizing &amp;ldquo;sinful&amp;rdquo; lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eusebius wanted to create some doctrine to help people live their lives. Lactantius wished to avoid the end of the world. And Constantine, well, he wanted to create a religion that would bring his Empire together. He didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to do this; it was Theodosius about 50 years later. But I think we can say he did give it a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his studies, Conde Torrens discovered that the authors of the New Testament had left much evidence behind. For instance, Eusebius, who was not happy with Lactantius&amp;rsquo;s line of work, left several acrostics throughout the texts (acronyms used in compositions written in verse). The use of acrostics was a widespread practice then, so it is no surprise he did so. Interestingly, these acrostics are meant to make fun of the text as they mean something like &amp;ldquo;I laugh out loud&amp;rdquo;. It seems to be a way of stating his disagreements with Lactantius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although unintentionally, Lactantius also left footprints. At that time, scribes regularly used a personal pattern in their texts to mark authenticity. Lactantius was a proud man and a professor of rhetoric, so he used a highly complex one that would demonstrate his skills. It showed his ability, sure, but it also left tracks that could be traced back to his previous works. Thanks to this unique pattern, Fernando Conde could also see that some of Lactantius&amp;rsquo; texts had been modified later on, possibly by Eusebius, who lived longer than him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gospels were not enough to validate a religion, so they kept on writing, repeating the same things over and over and adding some agnostic and heretic testimonies that would provide more realism to the story. They did a pretty good job indeed; because seventeen centuries later, the world spins around the belief that a prophet named Jesus ever walked the Earth. Christians, Muslims and other religions all together managed to keep this fictional character alive, just like Skywalker or Don Quijote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this article, I am not questioning anyone&amp;rsquo;s faith in God. God can be a spiritual being, Nature itself or just a feeling of uncertainty. You are the one to decide that. But Jesus is just a tale, and the whole establishment created around it that goes by the name of the Christian Church is the invention of a few men in their search for power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It saddens me to think of all that knowledge, now lost, that the expansion of Christianity (and other monotheistic religions that followed) has banished from humanity&amp;rsquo;s old collective and diverse culture. In the same way that some of the Christian teachings can be wise, many other religions and beliefs would have provided a philosophical aid to manage our current world. We should be crying out for the American tribes that perished, for the African ones we ignore, for the flexibility of polytheism and for the ancient heathen knowledge that is long gone. What saddens me the most is the detachment from nature that the monotheistic way of looking at morality and ethics has imposed on us. But that is another article that I should write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the 31st of October, you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of it as Halloween, and you possibly consider it the Night of the Witches. You may think of it as spells, pumpkins and candy, but its origins have little to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything started in Europe, precisely in the &lt;strong&gt;Celtic nations&lt;/strong&gt;. The tradition originates in the druid festivity of Samhain, which actually didn&amp;rsquo;t have a specific date but was celebrated around the 5th-7th of November. Celts were a culture with great devotion to Nature, so the origin of Halloween has much to do with &lt;strong&gt;the end of the harvest&lt;/strong&gt;. When all the land work was finished, it was time to enjoy all the goods, but also, it was time for reflection. Very much like New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve for us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spirituality&#34;&gt;Spirituality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Samhain ended with &lt;strong&gt;the Gathering of the Spirits&lt;/strong&gt;. The belief is that, during that night, the ancient burial mounds were open, seen as portals to the Otherworld. The most fearless living dared to enter the realms of the spirits, wandering in them (just like in the movie &amp;ldquo;Coco&amp;rdquo;) and getting some insights about life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of spirituality; however, none had anything to do with God or the Christian religion until much later. All of them were pagan traditions with a tight relationship with Nature. Pope Gregory III saw the success of the &lt;strong&gt;Roman Pagan Festival&lt;/strong&gt; of Lemuria and wanted to give this date a Christian meaning. Romans celebrated a feast during which they performed rites to exorcise the malevolent and fearful ghosts of the dead from their homes. The Pope perceived this as profane and potentially threatening and decided to move the &lt;strong&gt;All Saint&amp;rsquo;s Day&lt;/strong&gt; (All Hallows&amp;rsquo;Day) that used to be honoured on the 13th of May to the 1st of November, overlapping and eclipsing the pagan festivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we use a pumpkin as a Halloween symbol, but a pumpkin was not always the preferred vegetable to empty. In some parts of Europe, they used turnips. Yes, &lt;strong&gt;turnips&lt;/strong&gt;! In the same way we do now, a turnip was opened, and a candle was placed inside. The pumpkin tradition is originally from &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;, and since they look so cool, it expanded worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, nobody can imagine Halloween without &lt;strong&gt;candy&lt;/strong&gt;, but that was not a thing a couple of centuries ago. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there weren&amp;rsquo;t any sweets. At the end of the harvest, nuts such as &lt;strong&gt;almonds&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;chestnuts&lt;/strong&gt; were widely available, so things like &lt;em&gt;marron glacé&lt;/em&gt; and marzipan &lt;em&gt;Saint&amp;rsquo;s Bones&lt;/em&gt; were a common option. This time of the year is also blessed with plenty of apples and grapes, which means the drinks of choice were &lt;strong&gt;new wine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sweet cider&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say there is no time like the present, and we live quite a weird one. We have forgotten what it is to be a living being that needs &lt;strong&gt;the generosity of the land to survive&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s probably why many people are starting to return to this old tradition that allows us to connect with nature and our spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People want to understand what it means to be human. People start to wonder what vegetables are grown each season, not out of innocent curiosity but because they know that the only way out of this climate apocalypse is by treating Nature more respectfully. People are hopelessly losing any sense of time as seasons are starting to banish due to the extreme changes in the weather. &lt;strong&gt;Hurricanes, droughts and growing deserts are just signs of Nature&amp;rsquo;s wrath.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like in any other belief, if you fear your God, in this case, Nature, the wise thing to do is pray. Celebrate a bountiful harvest (&lt;strong&gt;eat fresh&lt;/strong&gt;), ask the spirits to show you the right way (&lt;strong&gt;reflect&lt;/strong&gt;), and thank them for what you still have (&lt;strong&gt;take care of the land&lt;/strong&gt; for next year&amp;rsquo;s planting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Happy Samhain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world feels big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big like the desert when you just leave the oasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaos burns full of entropy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like the skin of my feet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stepping on boiling sand bathed with dry heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot bare any more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the details of this reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be drowsy and bored&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with some soothing fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this strong and wild and feverish curiosity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;draws me to facts like a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if I have the capacity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to comprehend its complexity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I try hard to seek the truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and exchange it for my beliefs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hoping that the sacrifice will help society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense now, all this anxiety?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/ceo.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The fine line to madness is being drawn in ICU" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;delirium-the-final-frontier&#34;&gt;Delirium, the final frontier&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever been so confused that you are simultaneously certain of your senses and losing your mind?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you had Covid-19 and thought you were about to cross to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one night, you were running a fever, and that veil between imagination and reality slowly faded away until you fell into a spiral of very uncomfortable feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you had been working so much and sleeping so little that you would gladly let yourself go into a light slumber right while you are performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry. No need to be shy. I have been there, too. &lt;em&gt;Floating in the unknown of the human mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3JOVTQ5h8HGFnDdp4VT3MP&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delirium is a state of mental confusion that comes on very suddenly and lasts hours to days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like a very alien issue, does it? According to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://americandeliriumsociety.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;American Delirium Society&lt;/a&gt;, more than &lt;strong&gt;7 million hospitalized Americans suffer from delirium each year&lt;/strong&gt;. I often wonder how many people go through it in the privacy of their homes and don&amp;rsquo;t tell a soul. It must be so easy to go unnoticed in a dysfunctional family. &lt;em&gt;Look, auntie Mildred is talking nonsense again… Let&amp;rsquo;s ignore her for a few days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delirium&lt;/strong&gt; is a psychiatric syndrome known as an &lt;strong&gt;acute confusional state&lt;/strong&gt;, a decline in our mental function &lt;strong&gt;over a short period of time&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s as though the difference between &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Delirium&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;delirium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Psychosis&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;psychosis&lt;/a&gt; is the amount of patience available to the witness. If the witness of such a mental state is willing to make an effort, the victim has a chance of avoiding a hideous label. If whoever is watching the affected contributes to the instability, for instance with gaslighting, then the victim has a lot more lottery tickets to go down the rabbit hole. But, since we lack much evidence to fully describe any of those experiences, I will leave that statement as a personal wild assumption that I needed to get off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway… What we know for sure is the financial impact of delirium. According to a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4559525/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;2008 study&lt;/a&gt; done on the healthcare cost associated with delirium, the national burden of delirium on the healthcare system goes as high as $152 billion each year. If you ask &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHDNMsDXvSs&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dr Aaron Pinkhasov from NYU Winthrop Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, he will tell you that it can get up to $164 billion a year. And now that Covid has sent a good chunk of the population through intensive care, I reckon that amount has grown even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But $$$ isn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest consequence of all. Delirium has been proven to have long-term effects on the human mind, as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc6149#auth-E_Wesley-Ely&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;E Wesley Ely&lt;/a&gt; often explains in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0Bo3LtzLYU&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;his public lectures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with delirium have longer hospital stays and lower 6-month survival than do patients without delirium, and preliminary research suggests that delirium may be associated with cognitive impairment that persists months to years after discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This negative outcome often has the looks of depression or PTSD between other manifestations, and it is known as &lt;strong&gt;post-ICU syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems that the intensive care experience is highly traumatizing, which in a way, explains why the mind enters such a state as delirium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the list of risk factors is as long as a Egyptian scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.icudelirium.org/patients-and-families/overview&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the &lt;strong&gt;Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship (CIBS) Center&lt;/strong&gt;. It is an organization focused on gathering and digesting knowledge in order to improve models of care for people affected by critical illness, especially delirium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc6149/tables/1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;table&lt;/a&gt; shows the most common risk factors for delirium. Some of them are intrinsic to the patient, as is a visual or hearing impairment. Some others are factors related to the illness they are confronting, for example, a respiratory disease. But here is an interesting group: &lt;strong&gt;Iatrogenic factors&lt;/strong&gt;. Those are aspects of the &lt;strong&gt;treatment that produce damage&lt;/strong&gt; even though they were meant to help in the first place. In that box are &lt;strong&gt;immobilization, medication&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/tabledelirium.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;sorry-about-the-tiny-picture-here-is-a-linkhttpsccforumbiomedcentralcomarticles101186cc6149tables1-to-a-better-display&#34;&gt;Sorry about the tiny picture, here is a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc6149/tables/1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to a better display&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been in an ICU, you will know that it is a very bright and noisy environment where heavy drugs are dealt faster than in Ibiza. We may see it as a low price to pay when it comes to helping people, and it is a fair approach to it, given that without them, many people would lose their lives. But what life are we talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients diagnosed with post-ICU syndrome have to leave their jobs and even forego a pleasant hobby due to the severe life-changing consequences of delirium. This is not one unlucky case, these are millions of people. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we at least try to go deeper into those risk factors that we can control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no determined way to manage delirium. In most cases, professionals fall back into antipsychotic medication and physical restrain. This is how it is been done, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have time or energy to go looking around for alternatives that would make their job even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366492/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics do not reduce the duration of delirium, they might control agitation and hallucinations, but they don&amp;rsquo;t improve the outcome of the patient. In this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364999/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;strong&gt;Haloperidol and Ziprasidone for Treatment of Delirium in Critical Illness&lt;/strong&gt; researchers found that the widely known haloperidol doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to significantly alter the duration of delirium compared to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what? Are we right where it all started 30 or 40 years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really. Wes Ely leading the medical community, has developed a patient-focused care method called the &lt;strong&gt;ABCDEF bundle&lt;/strong&gt; in which &lt;strong&gt;mobilization&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;reduction of medication&lt;/strong&gt; use and close &lt;strong&gt;delirium monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; have an important role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a medical community, we now have published data on over 25,000 patients in ICUs all over North America that there is a dose-response relationship between higher compliance with the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366492/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ABCEDF bundle&lt;/a&gt; and higher survival, shorter time on mechanical ventilation, earlier discharge from the ICU and hospital, fewer bounce backs to the ICU, less delirium and coma, less use of restraints, lower cost of care, and lower rates of discharge to nursing homes and rehabilitation facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because post-ICU syndrome affects not only the patient but the family, too, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34343884/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; have recently been put towards interviewing and learning about their experience and perspective. The results of this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32943306/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Australian study&lt;/a&gt; prompt the medical community to pay attention to the &lt;strong&gt;environment&lt;/strong&gt; as it appears to be the main &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;controllable&amp;rdquo; cause&lt;/strong&gt; of sleep deprivation, a great contributor to the development of delirium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants described the intensive care as a noisy, bright, confronting and scary environment that prevented sleep and was suboptimal for recovery. Bedspaces were described as small and cluttered, with limited access to natural light or cognitive stimulation. The limited ability to personalise the environment and maintain connections with family and the outside world was considered especially problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, when &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32684406/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;medical, allied health and nursing clinicians&lt;/a&gt; are asked about it, they show a very similar perspective. &lt;strong&gt;Professionals seem to be frustrated with the impossibility of providing comfort to patients and families.&lt;/strong&gt; When I was a student nurse, I spent a few months in a critical area, and I remember going back home and listening to alarms going off in my head as if I was still in the hospital, unable to turn them off. I cannot imagine how torturous it must be for those patients who find no possible rest from the constant &lt;em&gt;bleep bleep bleep&lt;/em&gt; that surrounds them. On top of that, you can add the pain and emotional baggage of a critical illness, though these can be palliated, they are not avoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that the bland, sterile environment, devoid of natural light and views of the outside world, negatively affected both staff and patients’ mood and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensive care environment is unconventional, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be so hostile. Think about how many technological companies modify their workspace to accommodate workers with special needs. These changes allow &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-neurodiversity-202111232645#:~:text=Neurodiversity%20describes%20the%20idea%20that,are%20not%20viewed%20as%20deficits.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;neurodivergent&lt;/a&gt; people to not only hold a job (which is already very challenging in the regular world) but to excel at what they are doing. If we take this example to the hospital, it is easy to understand the need to redesign the intensive care bedspace. An ICU room must be built with the needs of the people using them in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2019, Philips introduced &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/press/2019/20190425-philips-introduces-vitalminds-new-non-pharmacological-approach-to-help-reduce-delirium-in-the-icu.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VitalMinds&lt;/a&gt;, a new non-pharmacological approach to help reduce delirium in the ICU based on an improved design of the bedspace. This project monitors noise disturbances and manages the patient&amp;rsquo;s exposure to normal levels of light, which potentially allows better control of natural sleep-wake rhythms for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preliminary results of a study done by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://papers.cociwg.org/users/155154/articles/306834-modification-of-icu-environment-is-associated-with-reduced-incidence-of-delirium-results-from-the-vitality-study&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Alawi Luetz&lt;/a&gt; show that a modification in the ICU environment is significantly associated with a reduced delirium incidence. &lt;strong&gt;But why is this direction of research and development so relevant to mental health in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology and psychiatry are fields with very little consensus between their professionals. Science seems to have trouble getting to understand the human brain and, even more, human behaviour. I think we can all agree that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early this year, the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;World Health Organization (WHO) informed&lt;/a&gt; that the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by 25% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those are not issues that stay in the past. According to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1120682&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;UN News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;nearly one billion people worldwide suffer from some form of mental disorder&lt;/strong&gt;, as stated in the last &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240050860&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;World Mental Health Report&lt;/a&gt; published on 16 June 2022. Numbers are telling us that we are, and sadly have been for a while, suffering a mental health pandemia. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that reason enough to act on it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we take this &amp;ldquo;invisible virus&amp;rdquo; as seriously as we did with the corona?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a society that pushes us daily to work hard and to live fast. But humans are no gods. Humans can only do so much. I, that have experimented with the tortures of hallucinations and delusions, urge you all to look at delirium as &lt;strong&gt;the end of the rope&lt;/strong&gt;—that point where our mind finds a wall or an abyss. I don&amp;rsquo;t know which one, but I think we ought to know where the limits of the human mind are, or else, how are we going to confront this new pandemia of mental illness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was feeling numb when they came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No emotions or a flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started to chat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no anger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No envy, no revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was confused in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why didn&amp;rsquo;t they complain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life isn&amp;rsquo;t fair,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and everybody feels some pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I came to learn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that all those bloody blades,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;once I had to accept,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;were not offered by my new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was confused in a sense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because they were there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in case I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emulating them,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not whine or protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply had a story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky was I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for that, I found people who cared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so again,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was confused in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because, with fresh confusion, I was blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big turn in life, a good change.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blonde: not a biopic but an insight into mental health</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/blonde_not_a_biopic_but_an_insight_into_mental_health/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/blonde_not_a_biopic_but_an_insight_into_mental_health/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/marilynbook.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Blonde: not a biopic but an insight into mental health" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;she-was-everywhere-but-seen-nowhere&#34;&gt;She was everywhere but seen nowhere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I watched &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt;, the movie about Marilyn Monroe. I will not tell you about the director or the novel is based on. I will tell you about the shadow this film leaves behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative delivers the story in drops. These are powerful and have intense effects on your consciousness. We are talking about a story that, even though its scenes might not be totally real, is definitely accurate regarding feelings. It is not about what happened to her as much as it is about what such a life does to a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/marilynbook.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&#34;photo-by-pure-juliahttpsunsplashcompurejuliautm_sourcemediumutm_mediumreferral-on-unsplashhttpsunsplashcomutm_sourcemediumutm_mediumreferral&#34;&gt;Photo by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@purejulia?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;pure julia&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photography direction is on point. Every single scene is designed to offer the best possible setting to experience her emotions in your own body. The chosen colours and aspect ratio add to the message as much as the dialogue does. If this movie is about the dissociation between Norma Jean (her real name) and Marilyn, the film photography based on her classic pictures provides half of the information. You, as a viewer are not told or shown; you feel the story. And that is art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about a happy person, we often put them in a colourful environment with flowers, music and plenty of laughs. We still hold the misconception that someone who can seem to enjoy a particularly happy moment is not ill. We think that if they are showing their teeth, it means they are happy. This happens among the women in such high percentages that we came to consider that a woman who doesn&amp;rsquo;t smile is plain angry. There we have that hideous expression &lt;em&gt;resting bitch face&lt;/em&gt; as if a woman taking a breath from cheerfulness meant a threat to those around her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the topic, &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt; shows precisely that dichotomy in the most epic way possible. There is no glossier smile than that of Marilyn&amp;rsquo;s, but now we suspect what it was hiding underneath. The modern way of living has pushed many of us to isolation, spreading loneliness throughout the globe. I think I am not the only one who sees it. Maybe it is not a new problem, but I would say that, if anything, today mental health is becoming a blurry subject where myths are treated with the same respect as facts, and therefore an open conversation about the matter is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why did this film touch me so much? I usually don&amp;rsquo;t care much about celebrities. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get into the debate about Deep and Heard because I don&amp;rsquo;t think we should be playing this public trial game in which we generalize the privileged life of a few famous people as if they could represent the actual issue. During the whole court process, we heard very little about where all this toxic behaviour came from. We witness their passionate fights and discussions without any emotional reflection at all as though we were watching a soap opera. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about drama and to be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t care about Marilyn Monroe either. However, this is something else, this is the story of a child that felt incredibly abandoned, and to me, that&amp;rsquo;s one of the greatest failures of humanity. The pain that she suffered at such a young age not only stuck with her but shaped her personality so deeply that it became an important part of it. Nowadays we talk about mental health, but I often feel people don&amp;rsquo;t really understand how much a sorrowful past can do to a mind. On top of that, there are those creative and sensitive minds that in my opinion are more susceptible to the wonders and horrors of life. I dare to say Norma Jean is one of those minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a fortune to see the beauty clearly and soak yourself in it, but that clarity will also dunk you into the darkness of the world. You cannot choose, you may have them both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel compelled to recommend this movie because I wish everybody to grow their compassion toward those that are feeling lost and hopeless in life. Deep down, however, I praise this work of art because I long for people to understand my struggle and personal grief more deeply. Or perhaps, I hope to detect others like me in a light conversation about cinema. Either way, I believe that this film made me go momentarily to my very own dark places, but at the same time, it made me feel understood because I was being drawn to the shadows with every other member of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are an acquaintance with mental illness or just a film lover, &lt;em&gt;Blonde&lt;/em&gt; will make your body tickle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Weak In The Sky</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/paracaidas.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Weak In The Sky" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-poem-about-compassion&#34;&gt;A poem about compassion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think we are brilliant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when we see others’ wrong side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We treat them rough;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we ignore their shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if life wasn’t hard enough,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we forget to note when they’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what we’ve become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges of the weak and fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel strong and tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forget our own troubled times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without which we wouldn’t have seen the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the one who goes mad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the one who can eventually turn wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who stay in safe lands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seem sane, but they lack insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should honour a good crazy laugh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it is the inner fire lighting the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is beautiful and incredibly sad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how much we can’t see with our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the moon is dark,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is no interest on our part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the moon is helped by the sun,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we quickly find its charms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We taste their mutual love filling the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help each other, pals,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we will all learn to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, we will go forward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;away from where the &lt;em&gt;Lonely&lt;/em&gt; die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinging to old dogmas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;doesn’t allow us to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to remember that before you criticize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Isai Ramos&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;have-you-ever-thought-that-the-president-of-a-country-instead-of-living-like-the-richest-1-should-live-like-the-rest-of-the-population&#34;&gt;Have you ever thought that the president of a country, instead of living like the richest 1%, should live like the rest of the population?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not the only one. And it seems like a utopia, but no. It is possible and not a crazy idea after all. A Prime Minister once refused to live in the presidential residence and donated most of his salary to charity because &amp;ldquo;I earn more than I need&amp;rdquo;. According to him, the wealthy should feel the honour of being able to contribute on a bigger scale than the rest. He is the kind of successful outcast I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car that you see above is very similar to the one that Pepe Mujica drives. He is an Uruguayan politician and activist who refused to leave his precious old Beetle behind as he became the president of his country from 2010 to 2015. He also refused to live in the presidential house and remained in his farmhouse, where he still grows food and cares for his animals. This man had as much power as most of us could wish and decided to share it. He did this by giving away $257.210 to build homes for those financially disadvantaged and donating $60.000 in machinery and equipment. But these are just a few examples. His patrimony is the one of a regular citizen, and he still contributes more than many wealthy businessmen do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-pepe-mujica&#34;&gt;Who is Pepe Mujica?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;José Alberto Mujica Cordano started his political journey on the losing end of the balance to the point that in the 1960s, he became a &lt;em&gt;guerrillero,&lt;/em&gt; and by 1985 he had spent more than 13 years in prison. You would imagine that after spending so much time as a hostage of a dictatorship, he would become bitter and vengeful. Instead, he used his time as a minister and president to look forward and lay out a better future for Uruguay. He has never used politics as an act of personal revenge against those who hurt him so much. When he is asked about it, he answers with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are things that you just cannot forget, but in life there are bills that are not collected. They go in a backpack and you just have to learn to walk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a life lesson, but it is certainly good advice. After one has suffered for years, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of extending that suffering only to state the fact that you feel hurt? All the pain you feel every morning isn&amp;rsquo;t going away when you inflict it on others. By lunchtime, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be there. And at night, when you realize you just made someone feel as bad as you feel, that pain will increase. The only way to get some sort of payback is to make something out of that pain. You can create using those feelings, you can talk about it to make people aware of that painful reality, or you can try helping to reduce this way their suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feelings are impossible to control, so don&amp;rsquo;t try to control your grief because the past is written in stone. If you need to cry, cry hard until you finish your tears. If you need to hide for a while under a warm blanket, go ahead, but don&amp;rsquo;t stay there forever. Comfort food is also a way of grieving, though you can get fat. But seeking personal justice…. That won&amp;rsquo;t bring you peace. Actually, it will deepen the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Mujica during an interview in Spanish. Only hearing his voice feels peaceful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmjMBM1LSGM&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lesson-number-1&#34;&gt;Lesson number 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Succeeding in life is not winning, it is getting up every time one falls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s another one of Mujica&amp;rsquo;s wise sentences. As a &lt;em&gt;guerrillero&lt;/em&gt; he felt gloriously. He was not only imprisoned but tortured. He was captured. He lost. He failed so badly that anybody would think the game was over. However, after over a decade of cold loneliness, he got up and went back to follow his life&amp;rsquo;s purpose. This story tells me that sometimes it takes time before we can really start getting back on our feet. Holding onto a strain of hope might be all we need. If we forget about winning and focus on enduring, we increase our chances of success. It is a matter of statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lesson-number-2&#34;&gt;Lesson number 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want my son to miss anything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He misses you, &lt;em&gt;pendejo&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mujica often says that he has acquaintances who tell him they work very hard to get as much money as possible so their children will have anything they need. Pepe finds it sad and funny simultaneously because, even though they do it for their children, they can&amp;rsquo;t even spare an afternoon to spend with them. Mujica puts much emphasis on relationships. He reminds us that getting to know someone and creating a friendship takes a lot of effort and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also criticizes the accumulation of things, even empty experiences. Filling your house with stuff or filling your time with TV shows won&amp;rsquo;t make much sense as the end approaches. However, meaningful friendships can transcend the &amp;ldquo;here and now&amp;rdquo; of fleeting pleasures. When someone is in love, the happiness they feel is much greater and more lasting than the sexual pleasure of a frugal encounter. And so is everything in life. Just think about that couple of friends that you meet to play board games while wearing sweatpants. They mean much more to you than those you meet on Saturday for a fancy and expensive dinner in the best restaurant in town, just to prove how hard you work in your high-paid job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lesson-number-3&#34;&gt;Lesson number 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To be free is to spend the greatest amount of time of our life in what we like to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you want to spend your life&amp;rsquo;s time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you want to harness the miracle of having been born?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mujica asks this question to whoever wants to listen. And, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to wonder about it, he tells them: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, the market will take care of it, and you are going to spend your life buying things you don&amp;rsquo;t really want.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom is a complicated and relative concept, but I find Mujica&amp;rsquo;s perspective the closest thing to a definition. When we say we want to be free, we usually mean that we want to choose how we live. Some people also want to be able to do anything that comes to their minds. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is about that. The world is too complicated to grant everybody such choices. If individuals want freedom, it has to be something simple, easy to achieve, and of course, maintainable over time. That&amp;rsquo;s why I like Mujica&amp;rsquo;s idea of freedom, not because it offers many options but because it offers attainable satisfaction. In the supermarket, we see a bunch of different options for each product. They all have different labels, some have different flavours, and some have different sizes or packaging. We also see many price options. You can buy a well-known brand or the supermarket&amp;rsquo;s own brand. And then, of course, you will be offered many discounts and saving-packs. When you leave that supermarket, you might leave with the sensation that you have chosen your groceries with total freedom. Actually, you took those products that the supermarket has decided to offer you, which are often not an inch close to sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people know the power of the market, and in order to minimize its influence, they only go with a shopping list because freedom is to spend your money on what you want and need. Or how Mujica puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t buy with money, you buy with the time of your life that you spent on earning that money. And the time of life is not refillable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I listen to Pepe Mujica, I always feel like he is saying the most obvious thing in the world. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how many times he speaks; it is still necessary to remind us that we are humans, after all. We are animals who not only survive but seek happiness. We have been shown a path, and we recently found out that the path isn&amp;rsquo;t leading anywhere, so perhaps it is time to look for alternative ways of leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;machines-creating-wonderful-things&#34;&gt;Machines creating wonderful things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at this piece of meat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like a bunch of iron hinges, wood and wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t see a body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we see a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We misuse it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;letting our blood run free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We perceive them as waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even feel ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if they were a sign of our character weakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we so often forget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they are proof we are alive and breathing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when the body hurts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we finally understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that it is a part of us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reflection of our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it&amp;rsquo;s full of scars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imperceptible to the human eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bleeding wounds. Invisible ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are painful and chronical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are infected and smell bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, we think&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can be repaired&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We take oils, drugs or medicines;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hoping that magically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it, all, will heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here we are, continuing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because we keep forgetting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we are human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, indeed, we can create&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wonderful things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but we first need to dream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that we can only do when we are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-we-put-the-focus-we-put-our-future&#34;&gt;Where we put the focus, we put our future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the third piece of a series of articles that explore the effects of a specialized economic system in our society from a worldwide outlook. Here you can find previous articles:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why specialization matters in our society: About growth and scarcity &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/why_specialization_matters_in_our_society/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The environmental and political impact of specialization in our society: The worth of a human being &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/the_environmental_and_political_impact_of_specialization_in_our_society/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing social fights that don&amp;rsquo;t seem possible to be solved. These are conflicts in which both sides have very solid opinions with quite delicate arguments. I linked two articles to exemplify: the Dutch farmers&amp;rsquo; issue and the turn in US abortion rights. With both subjects, we enter a field where we get to question life itself. You would imagine that questioning life itself should bring us together. It is common ground, after all. Some of us more, some of us less, but everybody wonders about what it means to be alive. &lt;strong&gt;So, why are there so well-defined positions, so far from each other and very little space for dialogue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article about &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Emotion and pain&amp;rsquo; as Dutch farmers fight back against huge cuts to livestock&lt;/strong&gt; by The Guardian &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/emotion-and-pain-as-dutch-farmers-fight-back-against-huge-cuts-to-livestock&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article about &lt;strong&gt;Why abortion rights are under threat in America&lt;/strong&gt; by The Economist &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/03/why-abortion-rights-are-under-threat-in-america?utm_medium=cpc.adword.pd&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=a.22brand_pmax&amp;amp;utm_content=conversion.direct-response.anonymous&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw9NeXBhAMEiwAbaY4lqX8NV8A8-Zw1ipgIvxBWhuOzCzNLDsZfABZL_X5sHwl54STOkZe3RoCXLQQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/why-specialization-matters-in-our-society-b35bbcabd2b7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;first article&lt;/a&gt; of this series, I talked about the division of labour. Now I would like to go deeper into it, telling you how &lt;strong&gt;Émile Durkheim&lt;/strong&gt; (French sociologist) thought it impacted the organization of society. To do so, Durkheim focuses on &lt;strong&gt;social solidarity&lt;/strong&gt; and formulates two types that would describe two different societies corresponding to the time before and after the division of labour: mechanical and organic solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/solidarity&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cambridge Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;solidarity&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;agreement between and support for the members of a group&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When solidarity is based on a certain resemblance between its members we call it a &lt;strong&gt;mechanical society&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, people help each other because they understand the struggle as it is very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When solidarity is based on interdependence between its members, it&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;strong&gt;organic society&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, people need the help of others, and therefore, they help as a repayment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both types of solidarity are acceptable; none is better than the other as they work in groups with different specifications. A mechanical society works well in small communities, but when it comes to a globalised society, organic solidarity has its benefits. People don&amp;rsquo;t need to understand what others are doing to feel bound to them. But this initial benefit is turning against us. We have a complex interdependent society, and our brains cannot grasp the level of connection needed to keep balance. Yes, humans are social animals. Or should I say they were? We used to be awesome at creating communities. Nowadays, we, the average people, lack the skills even to hold a friendship or to find friends in the first place. &lt;strong&gt;Where is all this coming from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/bosquenevado.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans need connection, and this connection must be of great variety. You could think that in a mechanical society where everybody has a similar life it would be difficult to find such variety, and you would be right. But is it different when you look deep into our organic society managed by algorithms and professional hierarchy? &lt;em&gt;The availability of options for human connection is not an issue; however, finding the motivation to understand them is.&lt;/em&gt; We no longer need to deal with that that makes us uncomfortable. We turn around, we go to a different neighbourhood, we block a user, or we stop reading that newspaper. We have so many options that we only care about those that we actually like without leaving any space to learn about the scary unknown. We get so much ideological confirmation that we have no reason to think we might be wrong in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of organic solidarity have been widely discussed, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I am not getting into that. I want to point out some of the less beneficial consequences, consequences that can be mitigated without withdrawing from such a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the world, especially after a troubling pandemia, it is easy to understand that we all depend on each other. We rely on high-skilled jobs as much as low-skilled jobs. Scientists and doctors were indispensable. Cleaners and truck drivers were too. And that&amp;rsquo;s why I ask myself why we still value people&amp;rsquo;s efforts according to the market and not the actual value they have in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interdependence has no balance. We have to admit, in a conversation about politics (the art or science of government, the discussion about organising a society), we tend to give more attention to the CEO of a company than to those indispensable low-skilled workers. Given that the percentage of CEOs in our society is considerably lower than that of cleaners, truck drivers or healthcare assistants, I think we are doing something very wrong. And I am not saying we should implement any solution a random low-skilled worker would suggest. When I write a story, I then give it to an experienced reader to criticise. They usually find problems and also offer solutions. Most of the time, these are not the best solutions, but they found a problem I, as the author, could not see. And this is what politicians should be doing. They must start listening to the people experiencing the consequences of their politics and tackle the issues they say are the biggest concern. A good example is the energy issue we are facing. We see laws getting approved in which the government expects the population to transition to electric cars and homes with renewable energy systems. Well, the population is complaining about the prices. They cannot even afford the regular contaminating energy that we already have. &lt;strong&gt;What kind of solidarity is this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I thought education would make me wiser. That&amp;rsquo;s what we are told, anyway. It was after much struggle I realised that &lt;em&gt;plain knowledge without any reflection can be worse than plain ignorance with enough awareness&lt;/em&gt;. And this is the painful paradox that we have to unravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/why-specialization-matters-in-our-society-b35bbcabd2b7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;interdependence&lt;/a&gt; that takes the fate of many as the hostage of a few is no solidarity. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like interdependence, it sounds like codependency, and as we all know, such a relationship is an opportunity for abuse of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift to organic solidarity is the impact of specialization in society. People became workers, very specialised workers. We all have very different lives, and still, we live in the same society, a very diverse one. But that implies that within it we can find many communities because people will always need a sense of belonging, a feeling that can only be achieved when you are seen. In a globalised world, this is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity is dealing with many professions, many passions, many cultures… You can say it is easy to find your small community and be happy there. That is awesome, indeed. However, it is also easy to ignore arguments that don&amp;rsquo;t resonate with you. &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect me. It is not important.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity is not enough anymore; we need empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are facing the greatest difficulties that humans as a species have ever faced. Luckily, we are not dinosaurs, and we have much knowledge and technology at our disposal. We only have to be wise in how we use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particularity of humans is &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;. Thanks to it we are able to express concepts that cannot be seen. Thanks to it we can listen to experiences we have never lived. My adopted dog might want to tell me about his experience with his previous owner, but he never will. I wish I could understand some of his strange behaviours and eventually help him to have a better life. We both probably would have a better life. &lt;strong&gt;So I wonder, if humans have the ability to talk, why don&amp;rsquo;t we listen? Why don&amp;rsquo;t we use this beautiful gift we got to the fullest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, I read a lot about neurodiversity. For those of you who are not familiar with the term Harvard Medical School describes it as &lt;em&gt;the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way of thinking, learning, and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits.&lt;/em&gt; These are people who struggle in life due to a lack of inclusion in the job market and other areas of society. Some neurodivergent manage to adapt, often at the expense of their health, but many get pushed out to a corner. A family doctor who saw many generations pass by said to me that in the past, people with learning disabilities used to have much more access to jobs than nowadays because they could work along with other people and stay as apprentices all their life if necessary. Today, when you go to an interview, one of the first things they want is to see that you can be an independent worker. They want workers who do the job fast and with no help. They don&amp;rsquo;t want to think about them until the time to charge for a product or service comes. It seems that when it suits the market, dependency is not acceptable. But… &lt;strong&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t interdependence the critical point that sustains globalisation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the idea of a human no longer refers to a talking animal that needs food, water and shelter to survive. The concept of humanity is becoming a very different word: workforce. That&amp;rsquo;s why Elon Musk is so interested in convincing people to have children. He has a big empire to maintain, and only hungry mouths will have the motivation that he wants his workers to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only a few Elon Musk, but there are many humans that shape the so-called workforce. We have to find room to practice empathy. It is the only way to find a common ground that would allow people to stop defending their egos and start understanding what the real issues are. We constantly feel belittled by these lucky guys who tell us that the one who doesn&amp;rsquo;t thrive is because he hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked hard enough. And then we get angry at our neighbours for even thinking about Universal Basic Income when they struggle to feed their children. I don&amp;rsquo;t see any robots paying taxes or daycare. But I do see Musk and Bezos getting rich by the minute thanks to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidarity is not enough anymore because that&amp;rsquo;s what the rich do when they drop a few thousand on the poor just to get a good picture in the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need empathy because that&amp;rsquo;s the only thing it can actually bring us closer together as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am only saying this because I assume we all want to survive. And since I am not building Noah&amp;rsquo;s ark, I have no tickets to sell. Neither do I have money to pay for a seat in the last spaceflight leaving Earth. My only option is on this beautiful planet and its people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second piece of a series of articles that explore the effects of a specialized economic system in our society from a worldwide outlook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why specialization matters in our society: About growth and scarcity &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/posts/why_specialization_matters_in_our_society/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to market competition, our current socioeconomic system based on specialization encourages workers to get very good at one task or a few tasks rather than be mediocre at many tasks. Workers and products must be &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; to be considered worthy for the market. Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, but this means that in the system we are living, &lt;strong&gt;worth is measured in money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💰	💵	🤑	💰	💵	🤑	💰	💵	🤑	💰	💵	🤑	💰	💵&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is so because if you don&amp;rsquo;t have money, you have neither &lt;strong&gt;access to food&lt;/strong&gt; (basic necessities) nor the &lt;strong&gt;means to fund production&lt;/strong&gt;. In your personal life, you can have a different way of assigning worth to a person, but out there, it&amp;rsquo;s only about money. That is the main issue. The management of society goes around many other objectives, not just wealth. &lt;em&gt;These objectives are even more critical to humanity than wealth.&lt;/em&gt; Let&amp;rsquo;s take health as an example. Any investment in a healthy community will be a significant contribution to growth as it ensures able members and reduces the number of dependent people to be taken care of. Nowadays, we put a price on people according to their health. &lt;strong&gt;In this socioeconomic system, sick people are not worthy&lt;/strong&gt;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if is you, your mother or your little siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s evident that specialization has brought some benefits to our society, but it &lt;strong&gt;has come the time to assess&lt;/strong&gt; what we have been blindly doing all this time and what &lt;strong&gt;the consequences&lt;/strong&gt; are. I will be giving examples; please, understand that I am talking about the average citizen and not my or your particular case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;resource-management&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specializing in only one service or product doesn&amp;rsquo;t always mean simplifying. It often means we get more complex management to what used to be a more straightforward procedure. This complexity of the organization comes with many setbacks that enable systematic errors. Eventually, they grow as a snowball and sometimes have a crashing result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialization requires a constant flow of materials. We are starting to acknowledge that Earth has a &lt;strong&gt;limited amount of resources&lt;/strong&gt;. Some can be recycled, but most cannot. Once the mine doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any more ore to extract, all those jobs disappear along with the families that depend on it and all the businesses that were based on this material, not to mention the incredible damage it creates in our ecosystems. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s so important to be mindful of how we use them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about shoes for a moment. We have plenty of options in the market. All kinds of shapes and materials. All sorts of prices too. But, regardless, the majority of them will be thrown away once they need fixing. If a customer goes to a repair shop, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely they will be able to get a proper fixing. Maybe a patch if they get lucky. So, eventually, we all are &lt;strong&gt;forced to dispose of valuable materials without having the chance to extend their lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;. In these circumstances, repairing is a very generalist work because it requires knowledge about many different models/brands/designs of shoes and access to a great assortment of fixing materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack of all trades, master of none,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but oftentimes better than master of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We cannot keep consuming at this rate.&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s a fact. We need more generalist workers that can repair and avoid so much wasting. I believe this kind of job is our future because it opens up an opportunity that solves many problems at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;minimizes&lt;/strong&gt; the number of resources that we are using until &lt;strong&gt;exhaustion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;reduces&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;pollution&lt;/strong&gt; created due to the production of new items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It generates jobs that encourage imagination and &lt;strong&gt;creativity&lt;/strong&gt; rather than a sequence of boring repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, general reparation it&amp;rsquo;s usually a &lt;strong&gt;local&lt;/strong&gt; type of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what can we do if big specialized companies sell products that cannot be repaired or are too specific to be fixed in a local shop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since money allows you to decide how to approach business, they have all the saying. Conscious consumers might complain about it with their friends, but the average citizen (struggling with inflation and low-wage jobs) can only think about what shoes they can afford. The change has to come from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;food&#34;&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specialization of agriculture has helped us to improve food production in many ways, but it also meant the rise of monocultures. To reduce costs, large portions of land are used for growing just a single crop. This practice can be very &lt;strong&gt;detrimental to a region&amp;rsquo;s soil and ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;. Something similar happens with livestock. Animal breeding is much easier and cheaper when done in a big factory. Fewer workers are needed, and transportation is also reduced. However, it increases the need for &lt;strong&gt;antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;worsens animal living conditions&lt;/strong&gt;, not to mention the tremendous environmental impact. This type of business pours enormous amounts of methane gas into the atmosphere and pollutes the surrounding water reservoirs with bacteria from the faeces—all of this without adding the CO2 emissions that its transportation entitles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/josh-mcquaid-iHSzCgOFavQ-unsplash.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A food production system where the norm is a small local farm would have many benefits for the environment and society. For instance, it creates &lt;strong&gt;more jobs&lt;/strong&gt;. On top of that, the ecosystems will have the right variety of species to keep a &lt;strong&gt;natural balance&lt;/strong&gt;. As to exemplify, we can think of a more generalist type of farming where faeces are used as fertilizer and insectivore animals, whilst getting fed, are controlling infestations. The following video is a documentary that shows how very possible it is. We only need to share knowledge and patience to build such a world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UfDTM4JxHl8&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine we would produce fewer quantities of food, at first at least. But I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as an actual concern. Not yet, anyway. Every day tons of food are thrown away without it becoming a financial loss to the companies that own the production, transport and sale of food. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not like they are sending food to those countries where people are famished&lt;/strong&gt;. We have a food excess and an undesired environmental impact. I don&amp;rsquo;t see why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t we want to have farms with better conditions, more jobs and less pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;skilled-workers&#34;&gt;Skilled workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits claimed by specialization is better work performance. The specialist has more in-depth knowledge of a particular task he/she is conducting, so the product or service will be of higher quality. This is as much truth as it is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;strong&gt;ideal specialist world&lt;/strong&gt;, we have focused workers who know all details of the task, know all the protocols to be followed and have long-term experience doing so. They start and complete the task always in the same way, &lt;strong&gt;just like a machine would do&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jobs that are just very simple repetitive tasks, you often find a great amount of &lt;strong&gt;low-skilled workers&lt;/strong&gt;. As they lack the knowledge, they are in the position to make many &lt;strong&gt;small mistakes that pile up&lt;/strong&gt; over time and end up being very complicated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, developing a project or even the maintenance of a business isn&amp;rsquo;t always a simple repetitive task; you often have unexpected problems to solve or complicated improvements to implement. When doing these high-skilled jobs, &lt;strong&gt;it is a misconception that you can focus on only one specific subject&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, if you want to do it the right way, you need to understand your task&amp;rsquo;s impact on other team members&amp;rsquo; work too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the downside of specialization, when we look at workers&amp;rsquo; abilities, is that we find &lt;strong&gt;a lack of perspective&lt;/strong&gt;. When you come across a problem, or you are in charge of the design of a project, you need to look at it from above. It is necessary to think of it in a holistic way; otherwise, we tend to make decisions that might very well suit our specialized field, but they might become a huge inconvenience to our colleagues (working on the following task).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialisation promises an increase in happiness for everybody because it suggests you can choose how you spend your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you need a table, but you are good with the guitar, you just make music and get the table from someone else who is good at making them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satisfaction of the workers (the &lt;strong&gt;happiness&lt;/strong&gt; of us humans) &lt;strong&gt;is not so easy to reach in these conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. Oftentimes, workers are not becoming good at their specialist job because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make them happy. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s because they haven&amp;rsquo;t chosen wisely, but more often than not comes the reality that competition is so great that you cannot make money doing what you&amp;rsquo;re good at. Think about an 18 years old human who has to decide what is going to be &amp;ldquo;their specialization&amp;rdquo; for life. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of pressure. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them if they don&amp;rsquo;t get it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think they can always find a different job, but &lt;strong&gt;changing careers is nearly impossible&lt;/strong&gt;. For starters, you already have spent a lot of time trying to become a specialist in something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t match your natural skills. By the time you figure out what you enjoy doing and what you are good at, you realize you need money to survive, so you cannot leave your job. But &lt;em&gt;becoming a specialist in your newly found passion takes a lot of time that you don&amp;rsquo;t have, and while you are learning, you are not competitive enough&lt;/em&gt; to be hired for that kind of job. Yes, it is a Cath 22. Learning this new specialization combined with a &amp;ldquo;hated&amp;rdquo; job becomes so difficult that &lt;strong&gt;plenty of people give up on life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;international-political-game&#34;&gt;International political game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interdependence-of-nations&#34;&gt;Interdependence of Nations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may open your fridge and see that your mangoes come from Brasil, the jelly from Thailand, and oranges from Spain. You open a cabinet and find a cup made in China and some chocolate grown in Peru. That cabinet was designed in Sweden, and the bottle of wine you are about to drink was filled in South Africa. For us to enjoy all this luxury, our countries must rely on each other trading the goods and services of their field of specialization. This cooperation (interdependence) has considerably improved many people&amp;rsquo;s lives and even avoided escalating conflicts. But it is not as simple as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/EconomicInterdependence.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real world is much more complicated than our kitchen. &lt;strong&gt;Something so trivial as a change in taste or fashion can bring a whole industry to the ground&lt;/strong&gt; endangering the possibility of a Nations&amp;rsquo;s contribution to this interdependence system. So imagine the consequences when competition comes into play. The &lt;strong&gt;labour cost&lt;/strong&gt; has moved entire companies from one nation to another. Many countries &lt;strong&gt;disregard the working conditions&lt;/strong&gt; of their citizens only to lure big businesses to their land. We have seen how the USA harassed Iran, keeping them &lt;strong&gt;out of many trade opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; without apparent reason. The current situation between Europe and Russia reduced gas trading, and transportation prices rose. It seems interdependence can turn into a &lt;strong&gt;toxic environment where power is abused&lt;/strong&gt;. All that glitters is not gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deindustrialization&#34;&gt;Deindustrialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, deindustrialization becomes a natural consequence. When they choose to do it, a country loses their manufacturing industry in pursuit of services. &lt;em&gt;Robert Rowthorn and Ramana Ramaswamy&lt;/em&gt; sustain in their article &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.imf.org/EXTERNAL/PUBS/FT/ISSUES10/INDEX.HTM&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Deindustrialization — Its Causes and Implications&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;deindustrialization is primarily a feature of successful economic development&amp;rdquo; because when they look at the domestic expenditure on manufactured goods, this one has remained stable; so they think that &amp;ldquo;deindustrialization is principally the result of higher productivity in manufacturing than in services&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Finally, the paper suggests that advances in the service sector, rather than in the manufacturing sector, are likely to encourage the growth of living standards in the advanced economies in the future.&amp;rdquo; But all of this only happens because their &lt;strong&gt;advanced economies are counting on exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;. The exploitation of their citizen and exploitation of those citizens that live in developing countries that manufacture for the advanced economy. I am saying this because they are totally &lt;strong&gt;opposed to centralized wage-bargaining arrangements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are an Economics Professor at Cambridge and an Economist in the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund who consider that having a minimum established wage that ensures access to basic necessities &amp;ldquo;could have adverse consequences for the growth of productivity&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry if I don&amp;rsquo;t care as much about productivity growth as I do about the safety of most of the population. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it matters that Apple and Amazon are American or that Shell and Volkswagen are European if they are not doing anything for the future of their countries (and population). What matters is that when you are sick, need a vacation or want fixed working hours, you can get it as any human being deserves it. Look at this map and see how those countries with higher standards of living also have a more significant minimum wage too: Central Europe, Canada, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/mapWage.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;photo-httpswwwredditcomrmapporncommentscyk5frminimum_wages_by_countryinthourhttpswwwredditcomrmapporncommentscyk5frminimum_wages_by_countryinthour&#34;&gt;Photo: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/cyk5fr/minimum_wages_by_countryinthour/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/cyk5fr/minimum_wages_by_countryinthour/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you that economic papers like the one I referred to earlier are often opinion based (in opposition to evidence-based). I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is fair for those of us who are seeking knowledge on this topic. Before you analyse the economy, you have to decide what kind of society you aim for. Preparing to write this piece, I came across an insane amount of what I considered misleading articles. &lt;strong&gt;Many economists mistake big companies&amp;rsquo; particular objectives with society&amp;rsquo;s general goal.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever someone tells you how the economy needs to be in order to function, ask them first about their goals. They might not even have thought about it. Sometimes we just replicate what some fancy dude in a suit tells us to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The worth of a human, the worth of Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that money is what moves the world. We are nearly 8 billion people, and that&amp;rsquo;s a hell of a lot of people. Ok, I agree. We need some trading mechanism, and money is the best option. But when we focus on &lt;strong&gt;accumulating&lt;/strong&gt; it rather than seeing it as a &lt;strong&gt;tool&lt;/strong&gt;… &lt;em&gt;We forget about humanity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you know that companies increase their revenue goals every year?&lt;/em&gt; They don&amp;rsquo;t contemplate just getting by as they ask the regular citizen to do. We live in difficult times, and still, &lt;strong&gt;billion-dollar businesses want more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a cow called Earth, and we have milked it all the way. We can give it a rest and hope that will help, or we can keep lowering wages and polluting the ecosystem until it dies. You can listen to the rich economists and &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; you will become one of them. Or you can &lt;strong&gt;join the educators, health professionals and ecologists trying to find a solution&lt;/strong&gt; to the problem the pursuit of wealth has created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you dare break into my soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;looking for gems that can be sold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to warm yourself up when it&amp;rsquo;s cold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and forget about me when you find a clear road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I do set a high prize&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for those who want to see my inside,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you have to understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so many times has it been vandalized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that loneliness feels safer than being advised&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with sharp words in a disguised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, please,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have a bit of patience with me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while I untangle all these weeds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and find the right strings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for playing the emotions I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t promise you anything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;special or interesting,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I vow to you I will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;put an effort towards honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that&amp;rsquo;s enough for a friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-growth-and-scarcity&#34;&gt;About growth and scarcity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first piece of a series of articles that will explore the effects of a specialized economic system in our society from a worldwide outlook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise if I say that our society is profoundly polarised. It&amp;rsquo;s enough to put one newspaper next to the other and see how the same story has two very different approaches, even though journalism is supposed to be a discipline based on objectivity. Through this article, I argue how these levels of &lt;strong&gt;polarization are an undesired consequence of specialization&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/Screenshot%202022-07-27%20at%2017-17-01%20Social%20polarization%20Wikiwand.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-purpose-of-specialization&#34;&gt;The purpose of specialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Industrial Revolution, the &lt;strong&gt;division of labour&lt;/strong&gt; emerged as a way of &lt;em&gt;increasing the efficiency&lt;/em&gt; of production. &lt;em&gt;Specialization is when a worker, firm, region or country concentrates all their efforts on producing a narrow range of goods and services to become the best at doing it.&lt;/em&gt; Workers specializing in only one task don&amp;rsquo;t need to comprehend the whole process. This condition &lt;em&gt;reduces the number of skills demanded by the job&lt;/em&gt; while increasing the quality of that particular step or product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a specialized economy to work, &lt;strong&gt;trade&lt;/strong&gt; is required. The concentration of efforts on only one product or service increases the availability of this particular one but not the possibility of others unless you trade them. Through trade, you have the opportunity to &lt;em&gt;reduce the scarcity&lt;/em&gt; of those things you are not able to produce. You can exchange the excess of your specialized product for whatever products or services you need. To simplify trade around the market, we use &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt; as payment for goods, services or even debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of economists claim that specialization is indispensable to the &lt;strong&gt;growth of society&lt;/strong&gt; because it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to develop complex products or deliver specific services. When it comes to technological advances, I agree with them on that. Humanity managed to decode all proteins and found a vaccine to help in the fight against Covid in an incredibly short time. That said, I think economists are missing what &lt;strong&gt;social growth&lt;/strong&gt; actually is. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into that further down in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reduction-of-scarcity&#34;&gt;Reduction of scarcity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits that specialization brings us is the reduction of scarcity. It is often used as an example of growth because it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to give citizens access to a broader range of goods. In theory, it seems true. In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s not so simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average specialized worker is often a &lt;strong&gt;poor citizen&lt;/strong&gt; (low-income citizen if you wish to give them a more euphemistic name). While these citizens are a part of the socioeconomic system and therefore are meant to have &lt;strong&gt;access&lt;/strong&gt; to all these new available goods and services, &lt;strong&gt;they have not&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s necessary for them to choose how they spend the little money they get, so even if the market has plenty of things to offer, they are not acquiring more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;_specialization-is-not-reducing-their-scarcity-but-broadening-their-consuming-choices-while-their-life-options-and-opportunities-remain-the-same_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specialization is not reducing their scarcity but broadening their consuming choices while their life options and opportunities remain the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2021-un-report-pandemic-year-marked-by-spike-in-world-hunger&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; reported that according to the United Nations &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;there was a dramatic worsening of world hunger in 2020 … much of it likely related to the fallout of COVID-19&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Here we have a good example of how, even though the specialization has helped during the pandemia, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any power to control the real impact of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this &amp;ldquo;Covid-period&amp;rdquo; example might lead you to think that this is an isolated issue created by the difficult circumstances that everybody had to deal with during 2020. Don&amp;rsquo;t let yourself be fooled. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a new problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic (left) shows how the prevalence of people suffering from lack of food jumped from 23% to 27.6% in the pre-Covid period from 2015 to 2019. As you can see on the map (2019), the southern hemisphere is suffering the most. It is easy to forget that there are billions of people struggling to get food when you are an economist playing with billions of dollars on a Monday morning. It is easy to think about all the benefits of having thousands of different types of shoes and shirts at your disposal when you forget about the people making them. People who cannot choose what they are wearing or how much they will be eating that very same Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an FAO report, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;an estimated 1 in 10 people worldwide are suffering from hunger&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. According to the data provided by the UN to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WorldoMeter&lt;/a&gt;, in 1992 we were about 5,4 billion people on this planet, and now we are reaching 7,9 billion. That means that, in 30 years, the population has increased by 2,5 billion, give or take. Thanks to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://worldwater.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;World Data Lab&lt;/a&gt;, we also know that currently, 2,39 billion people are living in water-scarce areas. In 1992, 1,35 billion people were living in such conditions, so today, there is one billion more suffering than thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the total world population increase consists entirely of people living in water and food scarcity conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 90s we have had the internet, we have many sorts of videogame consoles, we have computers like the one I am using to write this article, we have twenty different types of chocolate creams… &lt;em&gt;But can we truly keep saying that trade and specialization can reduce scarcity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hear that a county has experienced growth, you instantly think about economic growth. Social growth as a concept doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have a proper/official definition. When you search for it online, you mostly get information about personal development or self-improvement. Hopefully, there are some institutions like &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/ipa/08836.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung&amp;rsquo;s (FES)&lt;/a&gt; that are trying to analyze the international picture and propose a growth model not only based on economics but on sustainability and justice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional economist will tell you that measuring growth from an economic perspective is the best way to do it because money is related to all other aspects of life. It is easy to argue that there is very little that you cannot buy, and for those things, money certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, it has been said that the general economic growth of a country raises the incomes of the poor and everyone else in society proportionately. In the following video, you get an example of such an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0qHA93oOSc&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;source-real-gdp-per-capita-and-the-standard-of-living-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz0qha93ooschttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvz0qha93oosc&#34;&gt;Source: Real GDP Per Capita and the Standard of Living &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0qHA93oOSc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0qHA93oOSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Tabarrok explains why he thinks Real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Per Capita is the best measure of a country&amp;rsquo;s average standard of living. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real GDP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;is about the total income of a nation, and, mainly, it grows according to the total&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;production,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;which has a great connection to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the level of specialization of that country&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When you calculate the GDP per capita growth, you expect to get a picture of how much the standard of living has improved. As an illustration, he provides some data to prove the correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy or happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just for a moment, think about the impact that the specialization process has on the daily lives of citizens and their countries. Competition over energy sources between powerful governments generates &lt;strong&gt;long-lasting conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;. This means war zones where people lose their lives. Other countries go for a different approach; instead, they allow &lt;strong&gt;exploitation&lt;/strong&gt; in their country so that production can increase rapidly and they can be a competitor offering better labour costs. We cannot forget that, while the GDP of a particular country might increase, the GDP of the competition will decrease because when we look at the general state of the world, &lt;strong&gt;we see that scarcity hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped rising; which means it only has changed hands&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I cannot but think that the primary reason life expectancy has increased so nicely in this period is the drop-off in child mortality; a fact that is very well proven and connected to other factors like the obstetricians washing their hands before delivering a baby. (You can see this in the graphics below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/PIKIDqVCpgWhEFEMabfzXA.png&#34;/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialization is the best way to improve production efficiency and, as a consequence, revenue increment. &lt;strong&gt;But who is getting all this money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabarrok mentions that &lt;strong&gt;the Real GDP Per Capita measurement misses the distribution of wealth,&lt;/strong&gt; as in the case of Nigeria, Pakistan and Honduras which have similar GDPs while the prevalence of poverty varies greatly. This fact doesn&amp;rsquo;t discourage him, though, because immediately he shows a graphic that seems to illustrate that &lt;em&gt;growth is good for the poor&lt;/em&gt;. This statement got my attention, so I searched the paper and looked at it for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;here-is-a-link-growth-is-good-for-the-poorhttpspapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstract_id632656&#34;&gt;Here is a link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=632656&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Growth is Good for the Poor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is not particularly objective. It makes a bunch of assumptions that are then used as if they were facts to prove its theory. Most of the text is a display of a particular view instead of actual contraposition and research. And what worries me the most, the empirical strategy for measuring the income of the poor is very weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/growthisgood.png&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They define the poor as the poorest 20% of the population and given that Alex Tabarrok already stated that the GDP Per Capita doesn&amp;rsquo;t consider wealth distribution I think the research team shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have taken the easy road here as they themselves explained in a side clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We understand that the concept of specialization cannot be separated from trade or money, and we get social growth (or an increase in the standard of living) as its supposed great benefit. But when we are meant to measure it, we widely use GDP despite its doubtful reliability.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Are we making this mistake intentionally or is it pure ignorance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it seems like more people are realizing that this might not be the best way of doing it. During a Yahoo Finance Live Show, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Andrew_Serwer&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Andy Serwer&lt;/a&gt; highlights that GDP &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t measure the right things which is to say quality of life and sustainability&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/em&gt; and that there are other options to use as a guide when it comes to planning for the future of our countries. He says that countries like Italy, France and Spain, even though they are not always considered strong economies, are very nice places to live as they have invested in health and education for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rU6WMkILcwc&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;source-yahoo-finance-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvru6wmkilcwchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvru6wmkilcwc&#34;&gt;Source: Yahoo Finance &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU6WMkILcwc&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU6WMkILcwc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the availability of food. Those countries where the consumption of food that has been processed thanks to the magic of specialization is high are not the best places to enjoy gastronomy. In fact, their &lt;em&gt;cuisine&lt;/em&gt; is usually worse, and their eating habits tend to fall toward cheap, unhealthy products. &lt;em&gt;That might be a sign of &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo; but not a sign of an increment in the population&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing.&lt;/em&gt; If else, it is the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;polarization-as-an-undesired-consequence&#34;&gt;Polarization as an undesired consequence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When all this started, I mean, the specialization of services and industries, humanity expected a lot from it. We thought we would have better lives and we would eventually be able to eradicate poverty. Clearly, it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen; because &lt;strong&gt;people nowadays work more daily hours in exchange for proportionally lower wages&lt;/strong&gt;, and again, the amount of population living in scarcity is growing. Not only that, people struggling to get proper food and healthcare in developed countries are rising too. We even thought we could stop conflicts with a good trading deal, but that is proved to have failed, &lt;strong&gt;as trade and competition avoid as many conflicts as it creates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;_all-of-this-is-creating-a-massive-gap-between-people-fighting-to-survive-every-day-and-people-reaching-and-exceeding-the-so-called-standard-of-living-unaware-of-how-many-billions-are-very-far-from-ever-attaining-such-a-life_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of this is creating a &lt;strong&gt;massive gap between people&lt;/strong&gt; fighting to survive every day and people reaching and exceeding the so-called standard of living, unaware of how many billions are very far from ever attaining such a life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we have a matter of &lt;strong&gt;perspective&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a subject that I will get into detail in future articles, but it has quite some relevance in explaining why polarization is an undesired consequence of specialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a specialized world, a citizen will learn and build their opinions based on the knowledge that their specialization provides them.&lt;/strong&gt; It is only logical because we have a limited amount of time and attention per day to dedicate to our development (personal and professional). So it makes sense that in the pursuit of our careers, we focus on achieving a thorough understanding of a very narrow subject. It is great for inventions and discoveries, but it is detrimental when we need to comprehend others&amp;rsquo; perspectives. We spend so much time figuring out life from only one side of the room that we forget that there are many walls and corners. There are even doors that lead to other rooms with a totally different kind of setting. More often than not, we stay in our spot, as it is necessary in a specialized world. But then, we lack the knowledge that would allow us to communicate in a healthy and constructive way with others. &lt;strong&gt;Our opinions then get stronger and static, and our perspective shrinks until we see ourselves living in a polarised world&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political polarization:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;when public opinion divides and becomes oppositional&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic polarization:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;a faster decrease of moderate-skill jobs relative to low-skill and high-skill jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if we think about polarization in a &lt;strong&gt;political&lt;/strong&gt; way or in an &lt;strong&gt;economic&lt;/strong&gt; sense. The surge in perspective differences (being the discrepancy in the standard of living or the varieties in the focal point of their daily lives) creates a growing gap between individuals, social groups, regions and countries that is definitely an undesired consequence of our current socioeconomic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-intention-of-this-article&#34;&gt;The intention of this article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to demonize the specialization process. In research and technological development, it can even be crucial. But I think we have gone too far without measuring the consequences of it, without questioning where and where not should be implemented. Most of us complain about how fast the world is going. We no longer have time to enjoy just &lt;em&gt;being alive&lt;/em&gt;  because we are too busy &lt;em&gt;being productive&lt;/em&gt;. Well, specialization is one of the main reasons for its velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialization needs to be redirected towards an increase in knowledge and not in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only wish that, with this article and the following ones, some of you will start thinking about this differently. From a different perspective, I would say. Not so you reach a precise point of view but as the best way to walk towards a future where we all are willing to converse and find the solutions that we very much need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-poem-fueled-with-indignation&#34;&gt;A poem fueled with indignation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel judged by the lot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I am trying to be more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of the woman I left&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;behind when I was surviving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I revise my behaviour and my childhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I find terrible things,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but sometimes, I also find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do they judge me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For trying to be free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or for doing it differently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have any more time to spare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on people who never say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, your priority is your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-years-ago-my-husband-got-invited-to-join-a-football-group-for-amateurs-he-doesnt-like-sports-and-he-particularly-hates-football-he-sent-me-instead&#34;&gt;Four years ago my husband got invited to join a football group for amateurs. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t like sports and he particularly hates football. He &amp;ldquo;sent&amp;rdquo; me instead.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started playing indoor football when I was seven years old as an extra-curriculum activity I didn&amp;rsquo;t choose. My sister wanted to join and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of being alone with my parents. Of all things I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to choose in my childhood (there is a lot of them), this one actually turned out to be good later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned the basics of football in a very small team of girls and women of all ages. For a long time and due to a lack of younger players, I had to play against senior women. Much older and much bigger than me. I could say I got used to being the weakest, at least, in terms of physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a very well-behaved kid that did everything I was told to do (because life is a bitch and control is our mom&amp;rsquo;s favourite thing). Anyway, it made me a fast learner. I wanted to be liked and I soon managed to be an average player so the coach (a kind-hearted man with dreadlocks) decided that I should join the boy&amp;rsquo;s team. Mixed teams are allowed until you are 12 years old. I went along with it because people seemed to want me to do it. I would have appreciated seeing my parents in a match, but being part of a team had to be enough. In general, I felt out of place but the fact that they needed me as a player made me feel appreciated. Without I even noticing, indoor football became my sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-school-it-wasnt-the-same&#34;&gt;At school, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys appropriated the playground, being football the only sport they wanted to play. Of course, they often refused to have me play with them and they would call me a tomboy when I did. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have friends then so this kind of experience would happen to me and I would take it as the most logical thing. Girls didn&amp;rsquo;t want me around either, they also insulted me. So when the tough guy in the class invited me to play I couldn&amp;rsquo;t refuse. He was a bully who had it going for me… He allowed me to join them because he enjoyed having an excuse to hit me in front of everybody. I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the situation then, I was simply glad I had someone to play with. If I complained, I would get kicked out of the playground. This meant being alone one more day after many, so I quickly toughened up and learned to be fast and sneaky on the field. I guess you could say that some of my best football skills are mainly a defence mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-team-of-a-kind-hearted-man-with-dreadlocks&#34;&gt;The team of a kind-hearted man with dreadlocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have continued to play indoor football for years and years. At some point, we created a core team of 6 girls and we got to the regional competition. This is a heroic thing to do for such a team. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any money and nobody was willing to contribute, so our coach and the parents of a team player would drive us to the matches. I stayed with this team until it disappeared, right the summer before I went to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I joined another team, with the most terrible coach I have seen. There was no enjoyment in playing if you were not scoring every five minutes. I eventually left. One day I had a respiratory crisis in front of him, and instead of helping me, he ignored me and asked me to keep running. He is now in jail for taking advantage of an underage girl. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I am surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This put me off for a while until a guy I was working with invited me a couple of times to play with his friends. He also invited my husband and we all went. It was very casual and didn&amp;rsquo;t happen more than twice, but it was enough for me to get infected with the football bug again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband hated though. That&amp;rsquo;s why he totally refused the next time he got invited but said I would probably be happy to join instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-years-ago-i-arrived-in-a-new-country&#34;&gt;Four years ago I arrived in a new country.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined my current football group, I did because they were struggling to find people. On a Thursday evening, I introduced myself to a guy in football clothes waiting for someone. He was also new and didn&amp;rsquo;t know anybody from the actual group. We started with the regular talk about our nationality and such. He mentioned something about how popular football in Spain is&amp;hellip; And when the rest of the guys came, we presented ourselves as newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning was very awkward. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s a woman doing here?&amp;rdquo; I could see the confusion on their faces, but nobody dared to say anything. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to mention it. I went for a self-confidence look, and I held it as long as possible. One of them distributed the teams and we just started playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that first match, some guys approached me and congratulated me: &amp;ldquo;Wow, you do know how to play! You are fast!&amp;rdquo; I knew they were hiding that other part they were thinking too: &amp;ldquo;Wow, even being a woman, you can play!&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care any less. At that time, I needed somewhere to exercise. Indoor football has always been my thing, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any female team. So… that was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an international group of people. There are guys from all over the world: Brazil, Netherlands, Siria, North Macedonia, Yemen, Romania, Iran, Tanzania, India, Portugal… As you imagine, each of them has a different idea of a woman, and each one had to adjust to me in their own way. I heard all kinds of comments and saw all sorts of reactions. Some were amazed by me, and some would avoid passing me the ball. But eventually, they all adjusted to the idea that I was just another player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned how to play together. We know what kind of tricks the other can do. This connection allows us to understand what the other will do without saying. We care for each other when someone is ill or even missing the matches for an extended period of time. We tease the tough guys and encourage the shy ones. But, still, I am the woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-dont-i-leave&#34;&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t I leave?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I heard there might be a club creating a female football team, and I thought about joining. Just for a moment, though. They would be playing outdoors on a field, and I&amp;rsquo;m not too fond of that football. And most of all, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t give up on my boys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four years of playing with this group, I have friends there. I would miss our chats, philosophical discussions about cultures, and silly jokes during the game… In general, our friendship. Sometimes I still feel like an outsider, sure, but I must say, it is the place where I feel like it the least. It might have to do with the fact that from the beginning, I accepted I was going to be an unusual player, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t put any effort into hiding who I am as I used to do. Or maybe, at the end of the day, since we are all foreigners in this country, we are all outsiders, and they actually understand my feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, I had the opportunity to see some guys changing their concept of women because of this. Or at least opening their minds to a broader range of feminity. I have learned about them and myself too. My disregard for my physical well-being has been put under the spot since these guys taught me to stop when I am in pain and need care. I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I feel like Thursdays have brought me the strength to change certain things in myself, and I think I have to acknowledge it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s only a few people, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like a significant shift in society, but, hey, not everybody has to change the world. I am proud to be part of this corner&amp;rsquo;s change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-poem-with-disappointment&#34;&gt;A poem with disappointment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, with me, were there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the monsters yelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the sheets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hiding from darkness and scared,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you and I, trembling through a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You talked about dreams so I would forget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we were children living in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t feel safe, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or so I thought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;until time made you grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grew bigger, not wiser; I realised&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you made of me the victim of your crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be your friend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you only allowed me to be your slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take a breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were twelve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the weight of your body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pressing down my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were stronger and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You were my big sister,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I, of you, was afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You learned as good, even if it was wrong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what every day they showed in our dreadful home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you: It was not okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn&amp;rsquo;t know it then,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and sadly, neither today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control was your greater desire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so you tight me up with this invisible wire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to make sure my mind wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wander far&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;without your voice pulling me back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to your particular doll house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at least till my conscious started to rouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no heart walked, father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sharp teeth lorded, mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With indifference, ignored it, brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And between us, a war that we yet suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in pain, I still live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;purging the suffering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in hopes one day I&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the woman I imagine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lies inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a bloody wound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of a traumatic childhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;healing with the best tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which are poetry and the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-frustration-of-replacing-your-electronic-devices-every-little-time&#34;&gt;The frustration of replacing your electronic devices every little time.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Smart TV Stick (not a brand) stopped functioning after a year of good use. No more warranty, unfortunately. An update of the software was advised and that&amp;rsquo;s what we did. If anything, worse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My husband and I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy &amp;ldquo;luxury&amp;rdquo; that much. When we buy something we are happy with &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; stuff. If a simple product does the job, we don&amp;rsquo;t need a fancy one. But of course, we understand that cheap often means expensive in the long run, so we went for the middle-level option. It was the safe choice or so we thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it was functioning just fine. No pretty features, but working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, it started doing these irritating things like suddenly stopping during a movie or showing the image in a choppy way. Wifi is good. Internet connection is not the problem so it must be the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updates and rebooting were the solution, for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the choppy parts were more frequent, the apps wouldn&amp;rsquo;t start and when they did, it took them too long to show all the movie covers. In the lucky scenario where a video was started, it would run for a couple of minutes before throwing you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no more official updates available. It was unusable. After only a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I probably look like an old lady hitting the remote control in hopes of getting the battery charged. I definitely know I will be one of those.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Maybe we thought this particular Smart TV Stick would do the job just fine and it turned out it didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough capacity to run the updated software. It makes sense, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? I tell you already, that&amp;rsquo;s not it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive electronic devices usually come with an extra processing capacity in other to assume the heavy requirements of future updates without sacrificing their performance. You could say that my Smart TV Stick didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough capacity to run the new version of Android that was updated and that was it. A very logical, and plausible, explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in further investigation… Instigated by the fury of a bored engineer and his activist-ish wife… Discoveries have been made…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My furious husband, desperate to get his money in value, changed the launcher to a simpler version with only the basics. In plain English, here is what he did: he installed a new menu that manages all the apps on Android but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that much sparkle around. Nothing more. The application didn&amp;rsquo;t look as cute as before but it did the same work. As I said earlier, we don&amp;rsquo;t care much about fancy stuff. This of course has to be done by someone with technical skills. I am lucky to have one of those at home though not everybody does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this, we realized how many ads were showing on the screen before, ads that consume energy and processing time. It also made my husband think about the services that &amp;ldquo;spy&amp;rdquo; on us, those &amp;ldquo;invisible&amp;rdquo; programs that are always running to check and record every action and decision we take within the device. This kind of thing also increases the amount of work the device does at a particular moment. It means that if you are watching a movie and one of these services starts recording information, the system may overload itself, shutting down the app you were using and interrupting your leisure time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software updates often prioritize the collection of data and the advertisement of products over the actual functioning of the device. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to believe it. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to sabotage your customers, does it? In any case, my nosey husband had to satisfy his curiosity and try to deactivate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And puff! Running like a clock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to say we were shocked, but no. We&amp;rsquo;ve experienced how companies design their products so that once they are broken, no longer can be repaired. This is no different case. I wonder how many devices are thrown away and destroyed after an update. You would image updates are designed so that the device would improve and extend its performance. I am not saying they don&amp;rsquo;t make any improvements, but it certainly doesn&amp;rsquo;t show in the end product, as you can see. However, it allows them to make more money out of you through advertisements and data mining until they eventually stop giving you the minimum service for which you paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy our Smart TV Stick still works but that&amp;rsquo;s only the case because my husband enjoys fidgeting with this kind of thing. Otherwise, we would be criticizing whatever brand we had chosen while searching for a new device that, over time, would have the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lose our right to repair because the product&amp;rsquo;s construction doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow it at all. We get tricked into thinking we can use our electronics anymore after unnecessary software updates. And on top of it, they can take our data and sell it to other businesses, so we buy even more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is indeed a silly story to tell. Still, I believe it is a good example that shows why we, as a society, have to start thinking about developing ethical codes of conduct and regulations within the technological industries. Without laws to prevent tech companies from taking advantage of their customers, these &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; concerns can grow huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-it-is-such-a-great-idea-why-is-it-failing-nft-sales-dropped-by-92-and-nobody-is-actually-surprised&#34;&gt;If it is such a great idea, why is it failing? NFT sales dropped by 92%, and nobody is actually surprised.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently watched a TEDx Talk by the Spanish philosopher Fernando Castro about crypto art and the situation of modern art. This video made me start a conversation about NFTs with my husband that evening, who is a software engineer and a videogame developer. He has been reading a lot about the subject and I, as a writer, have my opinions about art. The discussion turned out to be very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5fa2JAWP78&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;smoke-sellers-the-price-of-empty-art&#34;&gt;Smoke Sellers. The price of empty art.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-non-fungible-token-mean&#34;&gt;What does Non-Fungible Token mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say &lt;strong&gt;token&lt;/strong&gt;, we are talking about units of value that are given to something, like those tokens you find in a music festival or the chips you need to ride bumper cars. You can get them by paying money. In the case of NFT you get them paying with cryptocurrency. &lt;strong&gt;Non-fungible&lt;/strong&gt; is the quality that ensures these tokens cannot be modified or replaced. This is achieved through a BlockChain (it&amp;rsquo;s a growing list of records owned by no one and watched by everyone) where the NFT data is stored. Each time the NFT is sold it’s like one more element is added to the chain, and verified by a bunch of people to ensure this new content is valid. This system creates an independent certificate of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this sounds a bit complicated but if you keep reading you’ll come to understand that it is actually very simple stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-have-we-been-promised&#34;&gt;What have we been promised?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art always raises its value during crisis times. This happened too when the pandemic started in the shape of an explosive increase in NFT prices. The explanation that we often got seemed sufficient at the time. We were promised that the NFT market would &lt;strong&gt;decentralise&lt;/strong&gt; the art industry giving artists more agency to get a bigger piece of the cake. This occurs through &lt;strong&gt;NFT Royalties&lt;/strong&gt;, payments that compensate original NFT creators for the use of their NFTs. Artists get a percentage each time one of their NFTs is sold. This way, it doesn’t matter that much if you, as a creator, were tricked into selling your art at a lower price than it’s worth. As an art collector, the system allows you to quickly get your certified digital art and then instantly become &lt;strong&gt;unique&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s how a lazy screenshot of the very first tweet got bought by Sina Estavi for $2,9million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-has-the-nft-concept-been-used&#34;&gt;How has the NFT concept been used?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying a random animal with funny colours for thousand of dollars became really appealing because it has an NFT certificate attached to it. Here is an example. You are walking around Montmartre (Paris) and you come to see yourself in an artist market. You see plenty of beautiful pictures but you are disappointed most of them are just another Eifel Tower. Until you suddenly stop &lt;strong&gt;to buy a picture from a seller who&lt;/strong&gt;, next to it, would give you a signed letter in which she states the details of your transaction. You know nothing about art and decide that this must be a good work of art if she is so caring about the authenticity of the pieces she sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not understanding the real use of NFT plenty of people saw here a great opportunity to make money. &lt;strong&gt;Speculation became a trend.&lt;/strong&gt; If you were in the NFT market it was because you understood how progress comes. You were just riding the first wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or was it a tsunami?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of months, we have seen a huge crash in the NFT market. One-third of NFTs have no value at all anymore and another third are being sold for a much lower price than when they first got sold. Sina Estavi, the guy with that beautiful screenshot with no interesting content in it, is struggling to even get a 1% of his investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry, other people, like Gauthier Zuppier, one of the funders of &lt;em&gt;Nonfungible.com&lt;/em&gt; (someone bought the right &lt;strong&gt;domain&lt;/strong&gt; at the right time) seemed to find a more intelligent and profitable way of using NFT. He is even talking about a stabilization of the market. He has a lot of hope about its application in the videogame industry. And to prove that, he has launched a videogame himself. It is certainly not the only videogame that brags about using NFTs but before you finish this article you’ll agree it is all bullshit. All those games would have been the same without NFTs involved. The only difference is that &lt;em&gt;in-app purchases&lt;/em&gt; look a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will explain using an online card game as an example. If you are a bit nerdy, you will know Magic, the card game that still sells very expensive physical cards. Now think about an online version that used NFTs. On one hand, you have the value that a specific card has in the game (points, strength, item, power, etc) and on the other hand, you have the value that that same card has in the NFT market (Ethereum, Solanaor any cryptocurrency). The value in the NFT market might be regulated by a Blockchain but when it comes to the value in the game this will be modified by the game developer. So if the company stops supporting this game, your NFT art will vanish with it, as it would happen if Fortnite closes its doors after you had bought a costume there with regular dollars. You can not use these cards outside of this game, you cannot even frame them and put them on the wall because they are digital pieces of art, so you are just paying (in cryptocurrency) to play a game. Totally legit, but for now, nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-actually-be-done-with-it&#34;&gt;What can actually be done with it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there has been a lot of talk going on about the application of NFT in video games. Some have argued in favour of &lt;strong&gt;interoperability&lt;/strong&gt; as the future of the industry. The idea is that you could be using your nice NFT-avatar in any videogame. You would be identified by it and it would be, again, unique. Or you could buy an item and use it in any of your games. Unfortunately, as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ramiismail.com/game-developer/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Rami Ismail&lt;/a&gt; (great game developer) very well explained in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mobile.twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1480404367459168258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1480404367459168258%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgameworldobserver.com%2F2022%2F01%2F14%2Frami-ismail-uses-simple-dice-to-explain-what-is-wrong-with-nft-interoperability-for-video-games%2F&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;his Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;, it is not really possible to do anything remotely close to it. The complication of making a video game goes much further than any advantages that the NFT might bring. Each particular game has so many details that even games of the same company cannot use the same exact images. Because NFTs can not be modified even the smallest adaptation would mean the creation of a totally new NFT, which invalidates their point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-real-purpose-of-nfts&#34;&gt;What is the real purpose of NFTs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I tried to explain earlier, NFTs are meant to be a certificate of authenticity of a piece of digital art (a file in the form of a photo, video or audio), nothing else. In fact, a detail that a lot of people forget about is that it doesn’t stop anybody from coping that file away. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ghuntley.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Geoffrey Huntley&lt;/a&gt; proves this with his “educational art protect”: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thenftbay.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the NFT Bay&lt;/a&gt;. He collected an incredible amount of files that, at least at some point, have been sold as high valuable works of art and put at disposal of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/markus-spiske-dzrZzKkbL30-unsplash.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing articles, we all search for pictures in Unsplash because unless we upload our own pictures it is hard to make sure we have the right to use them here. When you buy an NFT certificated piece of art you are simply buying the right to use a file that is stored somewhere. Exactly, in a practical manner, the same thing. That is why it makes no sense to buy some art only for the NFT that comes with it. When you are in Montmartre you don’t buy a painter’s letter in handwriting you cannot understand, you buy a picture that you can enjoy looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-there-so-many-websites-and-video-games-surrounding-this-empty-business&#34;&gt;Why are there so many websites and video games surrounding this empty business?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. We have another example of the Gold Rush dancing before our eyes. The first individuals who arrived at the place would become insanely rich. Then people would find out about it, and crowds started to show up. Of course, there was not enough gold for everybody, so most diggers only found an unprofitable business. But there were some people who always won. They were the ones setting up shops next to these mining areas. They would earn a lot of money from selling equipment to those who seek a fortune through digging gold. And that’s what it’s happening with all these websites and video games that promise you a bright future in the NFT market. They are playing a different role than all the adventurous buyers, and they are surely going to succeed. They already did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nfts-do-have-a-place-in-the-future&#34;&gt;NFTs do have a place in the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you completely start hating NFTs let me give you my last piece of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technological world is always facing a challenge when it comes to making things work on two different platforms. It is a challenge for users, nevertheless. That’s why &lt;strong&gt;we love standards&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember how happy we became when Bluetooth came into our lives? Or when we started getting all our devices on our personal wifi? QR? It took me a while to understand its advantages, but it turns out QR is the fastest way of labelling physical items with a huge amount of info. You get where I am coming from. NFT can become a new standard, used by artists and art lovers, in order to simplify the exchange of certified digital files. It could be used on platforms such as Spotify or Netflix, without the need for huge corporations or legal documents to back up and enforce the licensing deals. The advantage is that you would know you get the original version instead of a low-quality one and that somehow in the process the artist will get paid. However, I am quite certain there will still be a possibility to illegally download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;_if-you-think-of-nft-as-an-authenticity-certificate-it-is-easy-to-understand-that-it-has-no-value-by-itself-but-instead-it-adds-value-to-the-work-of-art-to-which-it-links_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you think of NFT as an authenticity certificate it is easy to understand that it has no value by itself but, instead, it adds value to the work of art to which it links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I think it is insane that someone would pay even a dollar for a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unless it is a clever well thought article like this ;)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/79975355881396786761602637374040090832606040567248787931625712915648270565377&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Here you can buy the NFT of this article and support an artist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;public-services-are-the-way-out-of-a-traumatic-childhood&#34;&gt;Public services are the way out of a traumatic childhood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I decided to break the circle of my family trauma. I used to live by the assumption that there was no way out of my suffering but now I know I was already walking the necessary steps. Steps that were there thanks to the public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in Spain (Europe), and I think that had a lot to do with the fact that I managed to survive. My grandparents were very poor, and from the way my parents behaved, you could tell that our family trauma is undoubtedly related to it. They would blame every problem on having no money, and then they would spend long evenings from bar to bar trying to find happiness. &amp;ldquo;We are poor, but we are a happy family, unlike our neighbours.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s the story they passed along to convince me to endure their unfairness. When I asked about anyone who had a different lifestyle, they were always crazy and evil people. When I showed a different opinion, someone was indeed putting strange ideas in my head. For a while, they were winning over my sense of self. I was giving in to our particular family cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother died when I was sixteen, and even though at the time I suffered because of it, I now understand that it also changed things for me in a good way. In Spain, when a parent dies the government gives financial help to the dependent children and to the dependent spouse. My mother was the main supporter so my father got about five hundred euros per month and I was meant to get about two hundred (as long as I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a salary above minimum wage). Since I was still underage this money went to him too until I was eighteen. Even though he would spend it on alcohol and I would have to justify every cent I would ask for food, when I came of age I started getting those 200 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in all European countries, but in Spain, when your family has a low enough income you are immediately suitable for a public scholarship, money that you will never have to give back. Not only do the most clever students get them. The grants are designed so that anybody can access education without being wealthy or excellent. And as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t drop out and pass the exams to a minimum level, you will keep having them till the end of the degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take any more fights with my family, so with a summer job, an orphan&amp;rsquo;s pension and a scholarship under my arm, I decided to go and live by myself. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what I was running from when I did this. I thought if I showed them my independence, they would respect me and treat me better. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of the emotional abuse I was receiving because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of my emotions at all. So I stayed in contact with them, still being their scapegoat. Nevertheless, it was a step forward in a long way to recovery. I started seeing other lifestyles and when I dared to ignore them for a whole day, I glimpsed what safety might look like. I think being able to identify safety is a key point to begin healing from trauma. And I know for a fact, that none of it would have been possible without the public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading many of your stories, I realised the American &amp;ldquo;you only get it if you have fought for it&amp;rdquo; mentality doesn&amp;rsquo;t take children into consideration. When you punish parents for being lazy and refuse to share with them in the form of public services, you are punishing their children the most. When you ask a teenager in pain to endure not only the abuse of their parents but the abuse of our society too, you are encouraging them to stick with their family traumas. You only have to compare American and European crime rates, drug death statistics or the percentage of people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying we have to give money to everyone, but there are ways to make sure some help gets to the children who can still be saved. Supporting young people between 18 and 26 years old to get an education it’s the best way to break the transgenerational trauma cycle. They are already independent of their parents so they cannot exploit them and at the same time, their brain is still maturing. It is the perfect moment to give them a real opportunity. Giving them a “&lt;em&gt;life mortgage&lt;/em&gt;” in the form of a student loan and stressing them out in an underpaid job it’s only going to establish what they already know: &lt;strong&gt;No one gives a fuck about them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;americans-if-you-love-your-children-you-should-love-your-public-services&#34;&gt;Americans, if you love your children, you should love your public services.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;maybe-not-that-story-you-are-thinking-about&#34;&gt;Maybe not that story you are thinking about&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met my husband when I was seventeen. I had lost my mother to breast cancer right a year before that. She gave me a scary childhood because she refused to leave my father to kill himself with alcohol. She told me she needed my father because she didn’t want to be alone once I had gone to college. My mother’s family lived in the same neighbourhood as us. We were in each other houses all the time. I decided that was an excuse. &lt;strong&gt;I promised myself I would never entrust a man with my future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my mother died and I stayed at home with my father, I felt so lonely. I kept saying that at least I had my brother and my sister; they are much older than me. &lt;strong&gt;As long as I had them, I wouldn’t be alone.&lt;/strong&gt; So when I met my husband, he was third on the relevance line and never to be fully trusted with eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years battling to survive, unaware of the rules. I gave myself to others in expectation of collecting potential helpers for when my turn of loneliness was to come. I became a nurse to ensure a regular supply of good karma. I disregarded emotions that made me feel weak or powerless, becoming as &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; as possible. A few years later, my father died of lung cancer, not liver cancer, ironically. It took me a few days to go back to normal. Then I continued with my life project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did well. I worked my way out of a low-income family to spend my honeymoon in Argentina. Yes. After eight years of unconditional support, my husband finally proved to me that I could start trusting him. I was never very romantic, so my explanation for me getting married was that I considered him the best person to decide for me if I were to be unconscious. &lt;em&gt;Love understood by a nurse, I guess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have my mother or a father, but I got married with the rest of my family next to me and a whole lot of friends. And I continue building this independent woman that could be anything and care for everyone and never get tired. &lt;strong&gt;People used to tell me that I never looked anxious or angry, I always had everything under control and could always squeeze a smile.&lt;/strong&gt; Now that I think about it, it should have been a huge red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those feelings I was storing in my body eventually started to flourish. I was finding it very difficult to deal with my siblings. My job was becoming more stressful than I had anticipated. My husband tried to support me, but I felt &lt;strong&gt;he could not understand me&lt;/strong&gt;. Being a health professional, I knew I had to get help. I did. I ask a therapist to teach me how to improve my relationship with my family. She heard the summary of my childhood, just what I wrote in the first paragraph, and she started to give me advice. She didn’t ask many questions. She didn’t need to know all details about the past, she said. &lt;strong&gt;I needed a good family relationship to ensure that, if my husband turned out to be a bad apple, I had them as my backup.&lt;/strong&gt; I really didn’t want to be lonely again. For a while, I seemed to improve until I hit a wall, and depression was all I ate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one day, with a different therapist, &lt;strong&gt;I remembered&lt;/strong&gt;. I started to talk about the relationship with my siblings at the time of my mother&amp;rsquo;s death. They claimed they were sick-worried about me, but refused to take me with them away from my father. They used me as their personal assistant. My brother (ten years older) wouldn’t spend time with me, only to eat the meals I cooked, which always had a problem, or if I went with him to help him at work. He wouldn’t give me any money for it, by the way. My sister (four years older) would come every weekend and summer to demand a clean house, clothes, and perfectly cooked food. She would always be in a terrible mood. Most of the time, it was because I existed. It was difficult enough for me to stay living with my father. Why did I have to do all those things? I was only sixteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did them because my mother untiringly told me I had to take care of my siblings. They are older, she would say, but you can be more mature. I want to think that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t often happen that &lt;strong&gt;the youngest child takes care of the older&lt;/strong&gt;, but something tells me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot count how many times a friend asked me how old my sister was. Given the way you talk about her, they would say, I thought you were the older child. It’s sad to think that although my wedding was filled with people, I didn’t have that many friends that would listen to me, nor I would dare to share any of it with anybody. &lt;em&gt;I was a weird, shady independent woman, I guess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met my husband when I was seventeen. I had lost my mother right a year before that. She gave me a scary childhood because she refused to leave my father to kill himself with alcohol. My older siblings refused to take me with them away from my father and they used me as their personal assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I started to put together all the pieces, I soon understood. &lt;strong&gt;I was always alone&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is only now that I can openly talk about it with my husband and feel his compassion that I don’t feel lonely anymore. Today, I can understand why my mother would feel lonely with her family around. I, however, would choose to be &lt;strong&gt;alone for real&lt;/strong&gt;—quiet and peaceful (chosen) solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say we are born alone, and we will die alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;but-we-dont-have-to-live-lonely-if-we-choose-the-right-people-to-hold-onto&#34;&gt;But we don’t have to live lonely if we choose the right people to hold onto.&lt;/h4&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2281.jpg" alt="Featured image of post One step further, one step closer to yourself" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;these-little-things-make-the-path-to-recovery&#34;&gt;These little things make the path to recovery.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying really hard to recover from my mental illness. I start to tell people that I have one, for instance. But the improvements come slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-recently-discovered-a-fascinating-and-ironic-behaviour-of-mine&#34;&gt;I recently discovered a fascinating and ironic behaviour of mine.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always had the guts to go out and do whatever had to be done. I was brave and willing, even if it was scary, dangerous or laborious. I say it &lt;em&gt;had to be done&lt;/em&gt; because that obligation feeling moved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born in Spain, and there, I graduated as a nurse. There were not that many jobs at that time, so I looked for them abroad. I moved to the UK barely speaking any English, and I started to work there as a health care assistant and then as a nurse. It was hard, but I only had a couple of thousand euros to survive, and I couldn’t borrow it from my family (the cause of my current mental illness). I am not comfortable around people, so imagine how difficult it was for me to learn my way around in a new country and learn a new language, which you can only do talking to people. I was scared, but I didn’t feel like I had the luxury of even thinking about it. Now I know that the difficulties I experience when forming relationships with people (work, friendship, etc ) come from my trauma. Back then, I assume it was one of the many defects that needed to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend decided to come along. I must say I am fortunate enough to have met him. In a sense, he taught me to talk. He always suspected I had some trauma, but I didn’t open up entirely about it until recently. He supported me in my personal way of going through life: fighting myself to attain what I was told must be achieved. I didn’t think I had a choice. I never felt I had one before, anyway. Life cards were dealt, and I was playing, ignoring I could swap some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge after challenge, I forced myself to become an open person. At least, according to my perception. In reality, I created a personality to hide my past from anybody I met me. I recently talked to a friend who wanted to know what was going on with me. He wasn’t sure if I had a mother or a father or none. I had never talked about them. I always avoided the conversation with some weird joke. That’s how big of a wall I build. Nevertheless, I succeed in my efforts to be “normal”. I functioned as an extrovertive woman and managed to work in a multidisciplinary team at Cambridge Hospitals, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pushing-myself-this-way-broke-my-mind-into-two-pieces&#34;&gt;Pushing myself this way broke my mind into two pieces.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, I stayed in close contact with my family, receiving from some of them their abuse and from others their emotional neglect. Deep down, I knew their behaviour was not appropriate, but I wanted to be understanding and show how much you can do if you show empathy. My Christian mother told me to turn the other cheek, and I didn’t want to lose hope in its power. I was trying to excel to be seen by blinded people. I was dancing with no audience, and then I broke a leg with only my husband as a witness. For him, it was like listening to opera. He didn’t understand a word, but he could feel the emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I engaged in therapy, but I kept my mask on, so I didn’t improve much with this first psychologist. We tried moving countries, but ironically this brought me closer to my sister and, therefore, to my pain. As if they waited for the right moment, the demons I was hiding in the deepest of my soul started to knock at the door. I was experiencing powerful emotional flashbacks, impossible to be ignored. My mental energy ran out, and I went full crazy for nearly a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was raised with the belief that family can not be broken, no matter what. You had to stick with it and forgive everything. You simply didn’t talk about it, and time would leave it behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert! That doesn’t work when no compassion or respect is added to the formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two pieces of mind I talked about earlier were: my family beliefs (based on surviving in this cruel, horrible world) and my personality (seeking a peaceful life). Only that my personality didn’t have space to grow, and this mask I created instead was becoming too heavy to carry. I was investing large quantities of energy in it, and it wasn’t bringing me any joy, even if I was doing something that I might like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-was-trying-to-put-together-a-puzzle-that-i-didnt-know-what-it-was&#34;&gt;I was trying to put together a puzzle that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it was.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is an advantage to going crazy is that your whole self shutters and you have the opportunity to inspect and analyse the broken pieces before putting them back. That is what I have been doing ever since. Of course, you keep choosing some that don’t fit, but you will notice it much sooner than before if you maintain focus. And this story is about an essential piece of mine. And probably familiar to most of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was a child, I have loved being in nature. I belive most people that are recovering from trauma can relate to this. I feel great pleasure only looking at a sprout or listening to animals moving across the vegetation. I like to pack lunch, walk several kilometres until no traffic can be heard and sit enjoying my crashed piece of fruit and excessively hot peanut butter sandwich. It shouldn’t be too tricky, right? Not after I moved countries twice. Not after I learned two foreign languages. Not after I went skiing down a red line the second day I ever skied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has been challenging. I did all those things for someone, with someone or because, out of obligation, I thought I had to. I never did it just by myself because I wanted to do it for myself. My family was happy for me to do all sort of grown up activities, like looking after a drunk father, as long as they benefit from them. When it came to me going out to play around the village, oh, that was dangerous. I must say, safety in Spain is not a concern unless you have a controller mom, then crossing the street on your bike it’s forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These last couple of months, I have been taking time for myself. I stay at home most of the time. When my husband is free, we sometimes visit a natural area, but he is not so much into walking long distances and my dog is small with painful legs so we are bound to that. I could go by myself but it’s as if I don’t feel entitled to go out alone. I walk my little dog around the neighbourhood because he needs to pee. I make sure I clean or cook something every day because I feel like I am a good woman. I try to write further in my next book, feeling time pressure. I don’t seem to do stuff outside if I don’t find an obligation to do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I was frustrated and going through an emotional flashback when I told my husband I couldn’t spend enough time in nature because of them. Well, that was not taken nicely, and neither it should. I was projecting my inner-child frustration, my fears. After a talk, we agreed I would spend time in nature whenever I wanted. He can work from home and he didn’t mind walking the dog during his break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I go! I am going to be the adventurous woman that I know I am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, today the weather is not perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, don’t be selfish, today you have to help at home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, you are probably too tired for such a long walk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excuses started to pile up. I was not doing what I wanted, and now I could not even blame anybody for it. Maybe I didn’t want it hard enough. Why would I behave like this otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the desire for natural adventure remained. So, yesterday, in perfect weather, after my husband ensured me he could perfectly handle everything by himself, and I was so rested that had gained some kilos, I found myself with no excuses and an open door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my bike, and I cycled to a close-by protected area. Yes, I don’t even live that far from nature. That doesn’t mean I didn’t spend that time thinking: &lt;em&gt;Maybe cycling there and back is enough.&lt;/em&gt; Those words… Those words sounded familiar. I am going to keep going and see what happens. I got to the forest and parked my bike. I was happy already. I could hear the birds, and my eyes were filled with green. It was a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after a few kilometres, again. &lt;em&gt;Where do you think you are going? This is going to take too long. Sure you have things to do at home.&lt;/em&gt; I stopped. I sat down. &lt;em&gt;If you go back now it’s still going to take you a while to get back. You are going to get tired, and then what? Go back!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I battle myself for a few minutes. I wanted to go further and discover the area that I could never go with my husband and dog. But this voice… This voice wouldn’t let me go. &lt;em&gt;You are a lazy girl, you should be at home working. There are children who don’t even have a home and you are here playing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is becoming a little bit too hostile, so I am just going to ignore the voice and keep going forward. Just a little bit. &lt;em&gt;Maybe I shouldn’t be doing the entire route.&lt;/em&gt; I bargained. &lt;em&gt;I will walk a little bit further, and then I will turn back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got up. &lt;em&gt;Where do you think you are going? You are not going to make it. You will come back disappointed and with your tail between your legs.&lt;/em&gt; I looked at the path I had in front of me, and I started walking, focusing on the nature around me. Each step took me further—just a little bit. I stayed focused on my surroundings. I began to forget about the voice. I could only hear life. Woodpeckers. Magpies. Blackbirds. Mouses were moving under dry leaves. Treetops were dancing with the wind. Fawns. Oh my god! I saw four fawns on three separate occasions. Each time I would freeze to see them pass by gracefully. It was beautiful. I could feel my energy filling up along with my self-worth and pride. I was finally out there. I was getting tired, but I didn’t care because it was only physically. I was not wearing my personality mask. My soul was light. I felt one step closer to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-can-only-have-a-sense-of-security-if&#34;&gt;I can only have a sense of security if…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend my husband and I met another couple for dinner. The guy is always willing to help, and  &lt;em&gt;the girl has “empowering people” as her life purpose&lt;/em&gt;. Now and then, we eat together and we play a board game. During this time, we talk about plenty of things: the weather, feminism, movies, capitalism, bitcoin, work…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lately, we also talk about our &lt;strong&gt;mental state&lt;/strong&gt;. On a previous occasion, I told them about the difficulties of living with CPTSD symptoms.  I was struggling to be around people, which made going to work a nightmare and I ended up quitting. I was constantly ashamed for letting myself be bullied not only by my parents but by my siblings too until I was 29 years old. It has been more than a year since the last time I saw them, and I still find it very difficult to set boundaries and fight for myself. I am mostly feeling weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends supported me. I didn’t even have to explain my trauma for them to understand that I needed compassion. &lt;em&gt;So when I saw that this girl was struggling, I wanted to help her too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t get into details in order to protect her privacy, but here is something that she said to justify the fact that she got &lt;strong&gt;a full-time job&lt;/strong&gt; on top of her &lt;strong&gt;full-time&lt;/strong&gt; university &lt;strong&gt;degree&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“ I can only have a sense of security if I have a job.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Now, this is totally understandable if you think of women trying to win the battle against the patriarchy. However, when I look closer into it, I see people &lt;em&gt;who lost the class war&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I did the same many times. I tried to juggle everything that I thought a modern woman should be doing until exhaustion. &lt;strong&gt;Exhaustion that I recognised when I looked at her eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it is often easier to see what’s going on when it’s not you who is going through it, and I was merely an observer here. At the time of our conversation, I didn’t know what to say, so I simply asked if she liked that part of herself. There was something I wanted to hear, but I couldn’t quite point out what it was. She said she liked it at the same time she agreed she had too much on her plate right now. Then the conversation when in another direction and we didn’t go any further on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only my mind got stuck on the subject.&lt;/strong&gt; There was no subject really, but I could not stop thinking about that sense of security she was talking about. I wanted to make her understand that she didn’t have to be afraid. Her husband is a great person who I know will support her no matter what. And us, her friends, will be there if necessary. I couldn’t understand it! I even got frustrated with my inability to help. She has to be able to feel safe as long as her basic needs are met, I said to myself. Then, still frustrated but calmer, I went back to search for a way to help her. &lt;strong&gt;I wonder what actually made her feel unsafe in the first place…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a sense of security, you have an answer to when it started, whether or not you know it yet. &lt;strong&gt;I know my answer, I thought,&lt;/strong&gt; my family was not a safe place to grow up and that’s it. Some people give me the creeps because of my past and that’s why I always have to push myself to stay calm when I am around some individuals. I analysed her life trying to find her answer but couldn’t put the finger on a particular one. My mind kept searching for arguments or advice to give her. I could not believe I didn’t have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going around these thoughts I suddenly shouted: &lt;strong&gt;Everybody has a right to feel safe no matter what!&lt;/strong&gt; Every child, every adult, and every animal should be able to feel safe the majority of their day. If she doesn’t need the money and she is already doing something with her life, then, why should she have a job to have a sense of security? It’s not like she could actually buy one. Anyway, we all deserve a sense of security &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. We deserve that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s when something clicked in my brain. I, too, deserve a sense of security. My inner child deserves a sense of security! At that moment both my body and my mind froze. For half a minute my eyes watched the air as though some kind of ghost was about to cross through me, or get into me. It must have been a lost piece of self-esteem because at that very moment, a huge weight fell off my back and all the shame for not being able to defend myself seemed to vanish. I realised I was asking too much of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everybody has a right to feel safe no matter what!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I will be able to support my friend as good as she has supported me because I am certain I would not be here without the compassion of people like them who didn’t even have to hear my story to see my pain. They say friends are like therapy. They are, even when you least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-trauma-changes-everything&#34;&gt;How trauma changes everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was born, my whole family (9 people) were living in an old rented house. Just too many. The space was so reduced that my sister and I even had to share a room with our parents. So, naturally, my mother wanted to give us a better life, a home of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents were hardworking people so, eventually, they managed to build the structure. Then some basic floors and basic windows made it look like a &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;. Some friends of the family contributed with old furniture and appliances. There was no luxury, but our needs seemed to be met. Unfortunately, that was never enough for them, not for my mother, anyway. Her dream was to have a three-level house where each of her children could create their very own future homes. This means that most of her energy and attention went into working and looking after the house so it would look a bit more like the ones from the magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading those paragraphs I imagine you cannot understand why after so much effort I would reject such a gift from them. And so don’t most of people that met them, because &lt;strong&gt;it is only this side of the story that they could see&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father worked hard. When he had a job. The problem is that when he wasn’t working he was drinking. He was an alcoholic without the intention of recovery. And even worst, quite often he would become aggressive to the point of starting a fight. &lt;strong&gt;During the day and to the neighbours, a peaceful pitiful drunk. At night, a nightmare that lasted years terrifying my mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my mother. She loved him. Oh, she loved him very much. &lt;strong&gt;As with her three-level house dream, she was determined to fix him.&lt;/strong&gt; She also used to start fighting so that he wouldn’t go back to the pub. She was scared that he would have a traffic accident. So the fighting got more prominent over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But he was a boy his parents sent to work on the sea too soon. The rough sea. That wounded drunken boy was stronger than my mother’s will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a trauma survivor myself, I get the fact that growing out of a traumatic childhood of getting out of such relationships is not easy but here is why I can’t really forgive none of them. Well, I can’t forgive my father for obvious reasons. He never stopped being a drunk and he died without being present a single day in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of my mother, the feelings are very complicated. It wasn’t until recently that I understood how much alienation I suffered from her because I was always focused on trying to protect her from him. And also the fact that she died when I was only sixteen didn’t help, I guess. &lt;strong&gt;Under those conditions, you sanctified people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand that my mother didn’t mean to create bigger fights, but while she was preoccupied with her husband, she forgot about her children. We should be independent and fulfil our responsibilities (cleaning, laundry, cooking and, of course, studying) because she had no time for us. She was busy being a superwoman. &lt;strong&gt;If we didn’t need anything from her we were good. If we needed something, we were selfish.&lt;/strong&gt; She was doing everything in her power to give us a nicer house and to make us look good in front of our neighbours. &lt;em&gt;“For our good”&lt;/em&gt; she didn’t want anybody to think we were poor or to know any embarrassing aspect of my father. And that took energy and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She was busy being a superwoman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t care much about being poor. I accepted pretty soon that my classmates had could have stuff that I could not. Of course sometimes was difficult, but I could understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I remember a day when my mother told me we only had 30 euros for the last week of the month. We could only spend 10 on food because the rest was necessary for my father. The funny thing is that she was not financially abused. My father was used to being poor and if he didn’t have money enough to go to the pub he would go to the shop and buy the cheapest wine. She was actually the one who managed the money at home, she had a better job. And that I couldn’t nor can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most toxic relationships, in most cases of domestic violence, women are scared of the consequences of leaving their husbands. They worry they are going to become even more aggressive and dangerous so they kind of grovel for their safety. I always thought that my mother was one of those scared victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a moment in my life in which I finally lost my sense of self, knowing I wasn’t worthy of her love. After a terrifying episode in which I thought my father would kill us, &lt;strong&gt;I put my foot down&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, I was not even 13 years old, but I did it. I used all my anger and energy into confronting my mother. I told her that I could not stand it anymore and while he was out I prepared a suitcase with his clothes and, ironically, his whole lot of medication. I placed it outside of the door and I locked up the door leaving the key inside so nobody could use another. My father didn’t even try to come in. He left for his parent’s house and didn’t even try to ask for forgiveness to come back. Looking back, I now realise &lt;strong&gt;he was so used to abandonment and rejection that it didn’t bother him&lt;/strong&gt;. He knew his behaviour was unacceptable and expected it to happen at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father came back home after “I gave permission”. My mother begged me and described his wounds until I understood he was a person in need of care. My father’s sister explained to me that their own father was a drunk and she had to look after him so should I do the same with mine. A friend of his came by and did the same. The man was on his personal recovery pad and wanted to help my father. So I did give permission. Or that’s what they made me believe because I had no real power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a moment in my life in which I finally lost my sense of self, knowing I wasn’t worthy of her love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerless it’s how that house makes me feel. Within those walls, my feelings have no room, my sense of safety shutters and love is painful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I would like you to understand is that a child can be happy being poor if their parents love them. It might be difficult sometimes to tell them no to things you would like them to have. But it is much worst to make them feel unworthy because you are too busy to give them any love and attention. And when I mean attention I don’t mean looking at them do silly things. &lt;strong&gt;I mean listening to their feelings, to what they have to say or to what is hurting them.&lt;/strong&gt; Because otherwise, you are going to have an adult child with more money than you had and barely any self-esteem (or even a mental illness like is my case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can blindly forgive my parents for their trauma reactions. They are not to blame for them. But at a certain point in your life, you have to become responsible for your own traumas and stop projecting your pain onto others. Nobody else will. Nobody else can do it for you. On the contrary to what many people think, it is not a matter of education or money. It has actually more to do with how much are you willing to leave behind in order to live &lt;strong&gt;a peaceful happy life&lt;/strong&gt;. Sometimes is a toxic relationship, a dream, or wealth—even family. You cannot have it all. You have to decide, or you will lose your mind. And that is &lt;strong&gt;pure chaos and unhappiness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-dont-know-until-you-understand&#34;&gt;You don’t know until you understand.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these new phobia words… are they really necessary? Here are my path and my findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned how to cook at a very young age. I didn’t have much access to processed food, so I grew up knowing what &lt;em&gt;real fooders&lt;/em&gt; nowadays learn on Instagram. I also saw how important it was for my grandfather to lose weight to get a surgery done. My grandmother would remind him every day how fat he was. &lt;em&gt;You don’t care if you die, do you?&lt;/em&gt; She would blame it on his beloved greasy food and alcohol. And on his lack of willpower too. I was still a teen when, following TV show advice, I designed a diet for him that allowed him to lose about twenty kilograms (44 lbs). I was proud of my healing skills. Looking after my grandfather and later my mother is how I developed an interest in a healthy lifestyle and why I decided to study nursing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential part of a nurse’s job is to look for potential risk factors, obesity being, quite frequently, at the top of the list. As students, we learn how obesity affects patients’ lives and worsens their conditions. We study diabetes and sedentary lifestyle (another two critical risk factors). And finally, we get to understand how to design a diet adjusted to every patient’s needs. What excitement to be able to change a person’s life only by controlling what they eat! Of course, we don’t forget about exercise. But that’s obvious: you get fitter if you move your body. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;right&#34;&gt;Right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it on myself, and yes, keeping a healthy diet and exercising often enough to burn those extra calories eaten on occasions was easy. Like most humans, I love cookies and chocolate, especially chocolate cookies. And sometimes, after eating one, I would eat the whole pack. But if this didn’t happen more than once a week and if I made sure to get up off the sofa a few times a week, I would keep my BMI within range. Just like my grandmother used to say, all I needed was a bit of willpower. Everybody overeats sugar to pace anxiety, and here I am managing it like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-then&#34;&gt;And then…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my anxiety got out of hand. I wasn’t even aware that I was stressed out. I did notice that I was thinner, even fitter. My colleges would tell me so. Some would even ask me what did I do to stay in shape. Back then I used to cycle to work and, being a nurse, I had quite an active job. &lt;em&gt;It must be all this exercise I am doing.&lt;/em&gt; So I adapted my diet to a high energy one, ensuring I was getting enough calories throughout the day. And off you go. I did it again! Proper diet is the key!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;careful-pride-talking&#34;&gt;Careful! Pride talking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as they don’t hurt other people, I value and respect anyone. Even if we disagree on how we should run our lives because I know that the consequences of a bad habit will fall upon ourselves. I just couldn’t understand why people wouldn’t educate themselves on a healthy diet (a balanced diet, not those quick-results diets) and an active lifestyle. With a bit of effort, they didn’t have to be fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unless&#34;&gt;Unless…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you don’t feel like eating, you are hungry and want to eat, but your throat is closed up like a hose under a wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You prepare the best lunch you can think of it. It looks delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even swallowing saliva hurts, but anyway, you start eating. You have to eat because if you don’t, you will not get the energy you need. Your colleages look at you while you are eating. &lt;em&gt;Are you not hungry?&lt;/em&gt; I smile. &lt;em&gt;I am a sloweater.&lt;/em&gt; And I continue eating until I can feel the gagging, stronger at every mouthful. I stop before it is too late. I would rather keep a little inside than eat any more and throw it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one day, I looked at myself in the mirror, and I saw my chest bones showing off. My face has reached a point in which a zombie would pass by and high five me. I would cry out of tiredness. I was losing myself, and there was nothing I could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only when you accept your vulnerability that you can see the strength in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;self-awareness-is-the-real-key&#34;&gt;Self-awareness is the real key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to stop working. I had anxiety. I was depressed. Being unable to eat when I was hungry made me feel very frustrated. That didn’t improve things. Doctors would ask me why I didn’t want to eat. I did want to. But it hurt. I had to forget about any kind of diet and eat whatever my body accepted. (Yoghurt was the worst, its viscosity made me throw up before the third spoon. I know, weird.) I would go for walks, to relax, but nothing more. I could not. It took me a lot of work and a few weeks before I managed to get back to a safe weight. And when I did my body was not the same. I had lost my muscles. I was fluffy and weak. I was still feeling uneasy. I didn’t know… And I started wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I read. I had questions, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so difficult to stay on a certain weight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if I was misjudging fat people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if people who have overweight also struggle with anxiety?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if their tendency to gain weight works the same way as my “ability to stay in shape”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was I being fatphofic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to understand. So I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/lyfefuel-4wtxPhvQZds-unsplash.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, God! All these people!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hearing offensive comments daily about their weight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking at plenty of advertisements, unable to buy clothes that make them feel comfortable on their skin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being stared at every time they open their mouth to get a bite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Receiving unsolicited advice, useless advice, all day long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I understood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t struggle with your mental health to start with, you’ll probably do after gaining some weight!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at myself in the mirror again. I didn’t care about my fluffiness anymore. Shit! I was privileged in today’s society. I was alive, and that was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-personal-take&#34;&gt;My personal take&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not defined by an image but by our genetics, environment, culture, financial status… Actually, we are not defined at all. We learn who we are and how to manage ourselves the best we can given each individual starting point. Luckily we evolve, but that doesn’t mean we can ever reach &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; image or keep it healthily in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even our health care systems are not acknowledging our diversity. Diagnosis and treatments are based on a particular model, and nothing is researched on the alternatives. Professionals are not being trained, so we often deliver more damage than care. Something has to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to stop judging other people’s lives based on our own experiences because we haven’t had the same experience or the same conditions most of the time. We have to listen more. We have to understand what we hear without immediately comparing it to what we know. Remember: You don’t know what you don’t know, and ignorance is bold.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The benefits of uberizing healthcare cover a dark reality.</title>

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is here but unfortunately is not Stark Trek’s future, not yet in any case. We don’t have superintelligent machines that, with a simple scanner, can identify the smallest issue in our body or mind. Instead, we have quite a fancy AI doing some part of the diagnosis job. Not too bad, though. But the rest, all the difficult decisions, data collection, and leverage, still falls under a professional’s responsibility. Or it should. At least, I hope people have learned by now that Google can not be your personal doctor (unless you want to feed your chronic hypochondria to a psychotic level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uberization: the act or process of changing the market for a service by introducing a different way of buying or using it, especially using mobile technology. (Cambridge Dictionary)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uberization of healthcare it’s been implemented in many areas, especially care at home. You have companies that provide professionals who help with personal and hygiene care, who give medication that has already been packed and prepared by a pharmacist (they are called blister packs or medication rolls), who give and administer medication that can vary every day, professionals who only take blood samples… &lt;strong&gt;You need a service; they have a specialised professional.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this because I myself have recently worked in this area of care. I would go to a house and deliver some particular care service. About ten minutes later, I would get going to the next, driving carefully but fast enough because ten minutes after crossing the door, I should be going to the following one. We, professionals, carry a smartphone that records how much time we spend with each of our patients and on the road. We get our planning with several patients that we are meant to visit that day. If we don’t get to their houses, those people won’t be looked after that day, with all the consequences that it brings. So we are constantly on that spot where we have to decide if we can or cannot give &lt;strong&gt;one more minute of our attention&lt;/strong&gt; to the old lady with no children or to the middle-aged man whose social life disappeared after the traffic accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/steven-hwg-zBsdRTHIIm4-unsplash.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;photo-by-steven-hwghttpsunsplashcomrebelvisualutm_sourcemediumutm_mediumreferral-on-unsplashhttpsunsplashcomutm_sourcemediumutm_mediumreferral&#34;&gt;Photo by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@rebelvisual?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am not here to complain about why health care jobs are not so rewarding anymore. What I wanted to show with this little rating is that those people in need of help get &lt;em&gt;many different professional visits with a very narrow responsibility focus and very little time&lt;/em&gt;. One of the biggest revolutions in nursing was brought by &lt;strong&gt;Florence Nightingale&lt;/strong&gt; and her way of looking at care from a &lt;strong&gt;holistic&lt;/strong&gt; point of view. We then started to comprehend that a person’s health has to be understood as a compendium of &lt;strong&gt;different needs&lt;/strong&gt;, as later &lt;strong&gt;Virginia Henderson&lt;/strong&gt; got to theorize. So, when as a professional, you only get to see this patient for such a small period of time and with only a subject (service) in mind, it becomes almost impossible to see that person as a holistic being. Even if you get a glimpse of it, you cannot really do anything better than say: “You should discuss that with your doctor”. A doctor who, probably, works under the same conditions and lacks the patient’s data needed to adjust the management of that patient. Because, quite often, a dependent person cannot communicate all their needs, sometimes they don’t even know they have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at it from a different perspective. Nowadays, everybody is about self-care, right? When you start learning about it, you realise how important it is to balance your diet and exercise (that keeps you healthy) with lazy entertainment and a sweet treat (that keeps you happy). Of course, you have to think about your mental energy: how much time you spend socialising and alone at your quiet spot. You also start thinking about applying moisturising cream every morning because it is better than waiting for your skin to show your age before its time. And these are just basic healthcare needs that most of us have. Now imagine how much attention is required for a person with actual health problems. If we reduce the time we spend with that person and share this time between many different professionals, I don’t think we are reaching our goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we talk about the uberization of healthcare, we have to understand that if it is well done, there should always be a professional backing every step, which means &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;. Why do I emphasize this? Because most people think that using an app means that the professionals don’t need to spend so much time with each patient. Think about those websites where, for a fee, you can have a video call with a licensed doctor. The virtual visit is likely shorter than in a clinic, and of course, only your bust is visible (also those other parts that you decide to show, but in general, just your bust). What does this mean for you as &lt;strong&gt;a person in need of help&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it makes life more convenient for those who live in &lt;em&gt;remote places&lt;/em&gt; and delivers some care where no help can reach, it’s no substitute for a normal appointment at the clinic. The doctor won’t be able to explore your body properly; that’s obvious, so more frequently than it should, the professional will be missing some &lt;em&gt;relevant symptoms&lt;/em&gt;. And this is crucial because we are human beings, and sometimes (a lot of times) when we go to the doctor, we don’t really know what problem we have or what we actually need in order to get it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in these conditions pushes professionals to &lt;strong&gt;prescribe wrongly&lt;/strong&gt;, not intentionally of course, but wrongly. On top of that, we have a perfect scenario for those with a drug abuse problem. They can easily fake it for a few minutes while hiding their shaking hands under the table. Instead of getting the appropriate help, they get… well, you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that virtual doctor visits are evil, but maybe, they should only be used as &lt;em&gt;follows up&lt;/em&gt; appointments once you already know the needs of the patient you are treating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my last point: prevention. Most health professionals will agree: the key to well-managed health is &lt;strong&gt;prevention&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to be old and sexy, old and agile, old and happy… you have to start looking after yourself today. And more importantly, if you want to avoid expensive medical bills, the same: PREVENTION. But the issue with this is that prevention requires a lot of education, and education requires a professional’s time. The thing is, this kind of time is not as profitable as surgery time, x-ray time or chemotherapy time. Education might mean that you won’t consume drugs anymore, neither illegal nor prescribed. And that it’s even less profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/adeolu-eletu-E7RLgUjjazc-unsplash.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;photo-by-adeolu-eletuhttpsunsplashcomadeolueletuutm_sourcemediumutm_mediumreferral-on-unsplashhttpsunsplashcomutm_sourcemediumutm_mediumreferral&#34;&gt;Photo by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@adeolueletu?utm_source=medium&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s not like we can do anything about it. It’s not the professionals, and it’s not what the clients need. It is what the big healthcare companies are willing to provide. If we are honest, we know healthcare is not a service that, adequately provided, gives benefits (financial benefits, I mean; social and human benefits, plenty). So as long as our healthcare systems are private and financially related to some lobbies, we will not be holistic people. We will be problems that need fixing and can be charged for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I feed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the pain,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;becoming the fuel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of my internal duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the fight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it elevates me high&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;allowing me to see,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and more importantly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to breath.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are we witnessing a behavioural sink?</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/are_we_witnessing_a_behavioural_sink/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/are_we_witnessing_a_behavioural_sink/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/photo_2020-01-29_14-48-11.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Are we witnessing a behavioural sink?" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-too-many&#34;&gt;One too many&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are 7,794,798,739 people on this planet and a few more astronauts out there. A significant portion of the population already lives in poverty, and the rest is going that way. We have a pandemic that we are struggling to control, and new generations seem to have little hope about their future. We can say that we have reached a point where decisions have to be taken. At least, we, humans, have the ability to assess, discuss and act upon survival situations. We have done it many times, so, why not once more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 60s, John Calhoun experimented with mice to study the effects of population density on behaviour. The experiment was called the &lt;em&gt;Mouse Utopia&lt;/em&gt; because he placed the rodents in what it seemed perfect conditions. They would have a limitless source of food and reduced infectious diseases. The mice population increased rapidly to the point where they started fighting for the territory. Then, new generations appeared that were not interested in social contact, and they would spend their time eating, grooming and sleeping. You can see an excellent explanation of the experiment in the following video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CXj0AGuh4c&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research is not easily extrapolated to human behaviour, but it gives us a hint about some of our current problems as species. We don&amp;rsquo;t even have a limitless amount of food, and we definitely have a huge housing problem. On top of that, we have forgotten to take care of some threatening diseases, even though that scientist had warned us for years. And now that we have to stay at home more time than often, we start to notice the effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until March 2020, we lived constantly running around without thinking for a moment where we were going to. I am talking about our future as humans. We have clearly reached what Calhoun named overcrowding. Look at cities like Madrid or Hong Kong. Thirty floors tall buildings are the norm and the incredible crowed underground is the paradise to Covid-19. If you want to follow the proper social distancing measures, you are reduced to a few square meters flat that costs almost your whole salary. Yes, we already fight over territories. We also have gone to the next step. We already have a generation that doesn&amp;rsquo;t care much about socialising, at least not in the old common way. The generation known as &lt;em&gt;Gen Z&lt;/em&gt; is born in a world were future doesn&amp;rsquo;t look nice. They are often called &lt;em&gt;soft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;needy&lt;/em&gt; because they publicly show their emotions, and they live attached to a smartphone what translates to different kinds of socialising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to lecture anybody about how they should live their lives. I am quite sure I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet how to manage my own. But I would like to leave my thoughts about this matter here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, we have an overpopulated world and a long list of problems to solve. Funny enough, most of them are caused by this overpopulation, or at least, they could be solved if the number of mouths to feed decreases (in particular those challenges to public health and food distribution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry. I am not going to suggest that we should leave people to die. That would be unfair, and actually, it is already happening anyway (Siria, Libya, Nicaragua). But, what about reducing the natality? We know there are enough children globally, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to keep making new ones. Why should we think that our genes are better than others? Why would you want to duplicate that unnecessary strange nose? Why spend thousands of dollars to create the perfect child if there are endless orphanages in many poorer countries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that some people want to have a copy of themselves to look at it and say: Hey, you are just like your father when he was only a child. But girls! Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest; pregnancy is not good for our bodies, and it definitely has an unpleasant ending. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice to avoid all that pain? I am not saying that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be mothers and fathers; I am talking about something else. I am talking about making adoption a more common practice. I know it is a complicated process. And of course, you have to fulfil some requirements. Still, when you have your own child, you also have to wait nine months, and you should also meet some basic requirements: like having primary education and really wanting your child instead of having it just because it is what everybody is doing. I know, right now that kind of world where you quickly adopt a child is almost &lt;em&gt;utopian.&lt;/em&gt; Still, I think it would be great if governments work together to create such a system where no child has to live in an institution, and at the same time, we get to reduce the world population to manageable levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethologist John B. Calhoun described behavioural sink as the collapse in behaviour which can result from overcrowding. We are now very close to that point. We only have to look at the political picture of the great world powers. Will we be able to avoid the behavioural sink, or are we going to jump to it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Errors make us human, and funny</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/errors_make_us_human_and_funny/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/errors_make_us_human_and_funny/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2675.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Errors make us human, and funny" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like being wrong. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s something you and I have in common. In fact, very few people like it (the ones they like it, they are usually funny). Mistakes are the fuel that brings our minds closer to the truth, but they hurt really bad, so we try to avoid them. Some chosen ones find in mistakes something beautiful, and it is when they can use them as raw material for jokes. But if you are just a regular person like me, funny only when there is an eclipse, you will appreciate what I have to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is only a concept, and it is different for each one of us. We tend to think that there is only one possibility, but life has plenty of meanings depending on which glasses you use to look at it. We could say that our truth is a bunch of beliefs that we have and we do not question, at least not often. And it is this group of beliefs to which we compare any new information that we get. But what happens when we get proof that one of those beliefs is mistaken? That&amp;rsquo;s when we go through the &amp;ldquo;experience of error&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We can be wrong or we can know it, but we can&amp;rsquo;t do both at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Heisenberg Uncertianty Principle of Error —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the last time that you realised you were mistaken. Think about that piece of information that turned out to be an error in your beliefs. And now, think about how you tried to avoid reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am particularly good at that. I have a lot of imagination, so I am really good at finding excuses to argument my mistakes. Nevertheless, we all humans have a common set of strategies to do so. We usually start denying whatever is in from of us. &amp;ldquo;These trousers have shrunk. I did not put four kilos in a couple of weeks. I am not eating like a pig every two hours. I am not…&amp;rdquo; It is so easy to deny the reality that half America voted for Trump and most of them still support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our capacity to tolerate error depends on our capacity to tolerate emotion&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Irna Gadd —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When denying it is not enough, we start to be angry at those who show proof of our errors. We see people with different opinions as to our enemies. They are threatening our beliefs, after all. In this case, it is easy to see then as ignorants. You can see yourself thinking about it sometimes. I am sure you have a colleage at work that seems a complete idiot just because he usually has a different opinion than you. He might be an idiot, but he might also be someone who can show you the truth that you are struggling to see. This denying behaviour is widespread between religious people who often think that those who do not follow their beliefs require education or are just plain evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very dangerous to drive this road. If you dismiss other people&amp;rsquo;s ideas only because they might hurt your set of beliefs, you can make even more mistakes, and some might have great consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When the facts change, I change my mind . What do you do, sir?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— John Maynard Keyne —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we don&amp;rsquo;t want to accept our mistakes still noticing their bad smell; we tend to justify ourselves with all kinds of arguments. Usually, we start undermining the consequences. &amp;ldquo;It is not as bad as it looks. It could have been worse. If I had it done right I could have happened the same…&amp;rdquo; If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t convince us, maybe because someone gave us an irrefutable proof, then we start blaming others. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know because someone told me wrong. I was almost right, and if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of that little detail, I would be right. It is not my fault that things are not the way they should be.&amp;rdquo; You name it. We find excuses for anything and the most impressive thing of all is that they are always the same: I don&amp;rsquo;t want to admit my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it finally comes: the moment we realise we were mistaken. It is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. You get a new belief that brings you closer to the truth, closer to see the reality the way it actually is. And it does it throwing you in a pool of embarrassment and self-pity. No wonder why we don&amp;rsquo;t like it. And it is also why it is so difficult to be funny. You really need to be aware of this and be able to take all that crap that seems to overflow that pool and make gold out of it. But when you do. Oh, when you do. You actually learn. You find lessons in those bad moments. And at some point, after eating a lot of shit, you end up looking at error as a tool to improve your life and not as a punishment for being yourself. Because that&amp;rsquo;s the problem nowadays. We search for error to make people feel worse when it is ourselves that we don&amp;rsquo;t feel good enough. And it comes all down to the fact that we don&amp;rsquo;t accept our own errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No amount of self-improvement can make up for any lack of self-acceptance&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Robert Holden —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting our fallibility is what allows us to learn and improve as human beings. No one is born perfect, and no one has learned everything that there is to learn. That is why &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt; is so important in our lives; it challenges our beliefs and shows us our own path. If we think that we can&amp;rsquo;t make mistakes, we will never get better and if we are scare of mistakes, we will never take risks that can potentially be very beneficial to us. It is understandable to be attached to our beliefs, but we should also understand that they are subject to being wrong. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we are bad people or that we are broken. It means that we have yet a lot to learn, which is not only natural but exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The root of suffering is attachment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— The Buddha —&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at it from a nicer perspective. When we go on a trip to a new country, we know that there will be plenty of new stuff that we don&amp;rsquo;t know about. We read about the history of the place or the gastronomy, but we are still aware that everything will be new to us. Yet we don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how new and different it will be. But we don&amp;rsquo;t really care because that&amp;rsquo;s the purpose of travelling: learning new things and getting to know new cultures. Now let&amp;rsquo;s think about it changing the new country for a new person with different beliefs. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to like the whole thing. Maybe some beliefs don&amp;rsquo;t make sense to you. But we all should keep our minds open to realise that someone else&amp;rsquo;s beliefs might be better or righter than our own. It is only this way that we get to experience being wrong as excitement. Similarly, we don&amp;rsquo;t see the error as suffering because we can easily let go of those old beliefs and make space for new ones. So, open up your mind and error as much as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spain finally legalizes euthanasia</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/spain_finally_legalizes_euthanasia/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/spain_finally_legalizes_euthanasia/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/eitanasia.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Spain finally legalizes euthanasia" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-the-17th-of-december-the-spanish-government-reviewed-and-approved-the-proposal-of-law-on-euthanasia-within-the-congress-of-deputies-not-everybody-was-a-supporter-but-general-surveys-say-that-most-spanish-people-were-in-favour-of-it&#34;&gt;On the 17th of December, the Spanish government reviewed and approved the proposal of law on euthanasia. Within the Congress of Deputies, not everybody was a supporter, but general surveys say that most Spanish people were in favour of it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-euthanasia-mean&#34;&gt;What does euthanasia mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euthanasia is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve chronic pain and unbearable suffering. Up to this point, only The Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Luxemburg and Canada have laws to regulate this kind of practice. Some others are in the process of doing it, and some have legalized a similar practice called assisted suicide (in which case are the people who want to die the ones who put an end to their life).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nice memory to hold on to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-proposed-the-law&#34;&gt;Who proposed the law?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitation of therapeutic effort or the palliation of pain are not only options but they are patient&amp;rsquo;s rights recognized by the law. However, this was not enough to solve the issue behind a dignified death as it is shown in the movie &lt;em&gt;Mar Adentro (The sea inside,&lt;/em&gt; 2004). Since then, euthanasia has been a matter for discussion between Spanish people, even though that, the law was not proposed until 2019 by the leftwing party &lt;em&gt;Unidas Podemos.&lt;/em&gt; Unfortunately, it was not even voted for due to the instability of the government back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last few years, Spain has seen how several patients publicly demanded a law for euthanasia creating even a platform called &lt;em&gt;Derecho A Morir&lt;/em&gt; (Right to die), in which they could register their wishes as to how they wanted to die in case they lost their ability to decide for themselves. This organization also helped to educate the population in any matter related to a dignified death, such as palliative care or the writing of a testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this and the famous case of a couple who videotaped what then was an illegal euthanasia helped bringing the subject to the surface. All Spain watched how María José Carrasco, suffering from MS, discussed death with her husband Ángel Hernández several times before he administered the medication that would give peace to his wife. He was then charged with a crime of cooperating with suicide but fortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go to prison and could continue his fight. Today he still misses his wife but he is proud and happy to see this law finally came through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-it-be-like&#34;&gt;What will it be like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, only patients in a severe, chronic and disabling condition can apply for euthanasia. The patient has to be well informed about what euthanasia means before any process is started. The application must be handwritten or declared by other means that can be recorded, and must show that is not the result of any external pressure. It must be repeated fifteen days later in order to avoid any changes of mind. Once the application is fully submitted two doctors will review the patient files to discard any mental issues and afterwards a commission will consider the case. Once it is approved, professionals have the option to invoke conscientious objection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;death-a-human-right&#34;&gt;Death, a human right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dignified life is something we all deserve by nature, but what does that mean? The idea of a dignified life is associated with the existence a person can lead when their basic needs are satisfied. By contrast, those who cannot meet these basic needs cannot have a decent life. And what sense does it make to live if you have no control over your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euthanasia, a dignified death, is a human right and therefore it should be respected. This 2020 more than ever we understand how important is to talk about death and its meaning. When we talk about death we are talking about human dignity and human suffering. This two subjects are delicate and avoided more often than they should. Allowing people to decide for themselves is the least we, as society, can do for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What nursing and prostitution have in common?</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/what_nursing_prostitution/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/what_nursing_prostitution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_8815.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What nursing and prostitution have in common?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo: &lt;em&gt;OMG how dare you!&lt;/em&gt;  by Lucía Ferro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I am going to speak about these two subjects from a European point of view since I am Spanish and I have lived in different EU countries. I wanted to clarify this because I understand that both jobs are seen in very different ways depending on your origin and experiences. I am also going to identify myself with a feminist and I am going to happily hear other opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;money&#34;&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have probably heard a million times that nursing is a very rewarding job. Of course, you do it because you have this incredible deep vocation towards care. Because, you know, specially if you are a woman, you are meant to love caring for others. I didn’t want to say it, but… female instint… Bullshit. Maybe you chose nursing because you like biology and all those medical stuff. Maybe you even find in nursing that human contact that you seek. But, let’s be real, nursing nowadays is not about caring anymore, it’s about keeping your patients alive until the next team comes and takes over. So, yeah, you are just there for the money because if you really care about your patients your instints are to start shouting at your boss asking them to put more nurses on the job. What I am trying to say is that maybe, each case is different, but maybe, prostitution would give nurses more money. Just saying…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bad-hours&#34;&gt;Bad hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this one is outrageous. Believe me when I say I would rather put on a nice dress, make up and all that jazz and go out for some drinks than to be like a zombie searching for tablets in the dark or jumping every time a lost patient asks for directions from behind a curtain. Nurses don’t have those free period days. When a prostitute has her period, well, she has an excuse. When a nurse has a bit of fever, well, she has lots of colleges talking about her laziness. It’s not because they don’t have good relationships, usually it’s the boss who puts that kind of thoughts on them. “If she really has a fever, of course I don’t want her to come. But, does she? Or is it just a headache?” You know what! I have something to say. If a nurse has a headache she should be entitle to have a day of rest. And you know why? Because nurses have to deal with lots of headaches that are not really their problem. So I would say, before they are ready to handle anyone’s health, we all have to make sure that those lazy nurses get their shit together and get rid of their fake-headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-environment&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear it comes. This is the right moment for you feminist to tell me I don’t know shit about what a woman deals with when she has to work as a prostitute. To be fear, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be in their shoes. And being honest, working as a nurse almost made me go crazy so I guess I would agree with you guys and say I don’t know shit about it. But just because I love giving my opinion I am going to say that a nurse hears plenty of sexual quotes that you wouldn’t expect to hear in a hospital. Also, nurses deal with very weird stuff like people hallucinating or bleeding like in a Tarantino movie. Nobody tells you about it until it’s too late for you to run and find another passion. Let’s admit it, nurses. We just trick people into thinking that nursing it’s a beautiful job just because we need more people on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just one more reason to criticize nursing. Everybody in the hospital is trying to survive the day. Very few people can actually handle it like pros, so very few people help you without neglecting their on health. Sometimes you get helped but mostly because there is this tribe kind a thing where a certain group of nurses have their own club and they help each other and of course, again, they talk bad about the other tribes. Just the same kind of bullshit you get in any other job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dignity&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dignity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last but not least: Dignity. The word that seems to solve so many religious problems and makes us think that nursing is far from prostitution. According to the Cambridge Dictionary dignity can be “the importance and value that a person has, that makes other people respect them or makes them respect themselves”. I agree with it. To me it is all about respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other hand, if we search in a religious dictionary like the Merriam-Webster we find a slightly different definition: “the quality or state of being worthy, honored, or esteemed”. In this case we don’t have an answer about who is judging you, but I would imagine they think is God. Just a big guy dealing respect cards to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dignity in prostitution is constantly questioned. Why I woman would give pleasure to another human being just for the fun of it? Why would she do oral sex if she doesn’t like the guy? Why would she prefer to do this job than to work as… a nurse? Maybe because when you are a nurse you have to clean someones ass just for fun. And not only their ass, also you have to clean all those tubes that go up there while the disorientated patient yells at you because he thinks you are raping him. Or worse, you have to make sure he keeps his hands in his pockets because you don’t want another unwanted slap in your ass. Why would she prefer to do this job than to work as a nurse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My answer is clear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let those girls do whatever they want. Just make sure you properly regulate their job conditions so they are not in a dangerous work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/gilmore.jpg" alt="Featured image of post I can&#39;t stop listening to David Gilmour" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-power-of-music&#34;&gt;The Power of Music&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I am listening to him right now. It’s not addiction because, according to the American Psychiatry Association, &lt;em&gt;addiction is a brain disease that is manifested by compulsive substance use despite harmful consequences&lt;/em&gt; and, even though I do feel drawn to his music, I don’t experience any harmful consequences. For that matter, I have found &lt;strong&gt;wellness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll explain. Sometimes, after I have written a post, I enjoy adding at the end of it a link to just one song. I imaging that I am choosing a nice soundtrack that helps the reader to reflect on whatever subject is discussed. It is also a great excuse to spend time listening to new music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I wrote a post about sustainability while buying clothes. This led me to search for a song that would profoundly talk about clothing. Yeah, I love getting a bit intense. So after going through some funny ones like &lt;em&gt;Boogie Shoes&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;KC and the Sunshine Band&lt;/em&gt; I eventually crashed against &lt;em&gt;The girl in yellow dress&lt;/em&gt; from David’s album &lt;em&gt;Rattle that lock&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It turned out to be one of those compositions that climb directly to your favorite’s list: because I love its jazzy style and because the lyrics are a beautiful poem.&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know how the composition happened but I would like to blame his writer wife Polly Anne Samson for it. I just adore the romantic idea of a loving couple working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I learned lots of things about David Gilmour. Although he is just a part of Pink Floyd history he is considered one of the best guitarists in the world by renowned magazines like &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Guitar World;&lt;/em&gt; being responsible for some of the best guitar solo’s ever composed. &lt;strong&gt;On top of that, he is an actual aviator (yes, with a plane) and a knight of the &lt;em&gt;Most Excellent Order of the British Empire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This last achievement might seem useless but it sounds cool at a family dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t a single song or an interesting life that made me get hooked to David Gilmour music. &lt;strong&gt;The best of listening to his art is meditation.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to his music I am learning to enjoy lying down and moving nothing. I might have chosen to be a writer but I am not a sitting-down-person. I am the kind of girl whose body needs to feel exhausted before I feel that I deserve a rest. &lt;strong&gt;Just a regular young woman trying to, excessively, proof that &lt;em&gt;‘yes, we can’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; What I mean is that I am one of those who struggle to learn meditation or any other concentration practice. And that’s why I got so excited about his third solo studio album &lt;em&gt;On an Island&lt;/em&gt; because &lt;strong&gt;it was when I listened to it that I understood I was able to focus.&lt;/strong&gt; I started listening to the different instruments, one by one and each with its particular pattern. I would pick up a gentle sound and I would concentrate on it as if there were no other instruments. Then I would jump to the next one and let myself go with the flow. After a few songs, &lt;strong&gt;I was still there: meditating and motionless but not exhausted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Gilmour’s album &lt;em&gt;On an Island&lt;/em&gt; has given me not only peace but the capacity to travel within that precious and scary world that is my mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What makes us humans doesn’t makes us hunters</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/oca.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What makes us humans doesn’t makes us hunters" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-dont-have-a-picture-of-a-wild-pig-so-here-youve-got-a-picture-of-a-cute-dog&#34;&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a picture of a wild pig so here you&amp;rsquo;ve got a picture of a cute dog.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://luciaferro.es/images/dog.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost midday. A group of men arrives to the settlement carrying a wild pig dripping in blood. A few children welcome them amazed by the large hunt. Deeper into the settlement a woman prepares the fire. They know: &lt;strong&gt;Today it’s a feast day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think about ourselves, humans, as aggressive, natural killers. You only have to look around and see the world. Some people would also consider that killing other animals is just a survival impulse. However, there are other noteworthy opinions. Donna Hart and Robert W. Sussman argued in his book &lt;em&gt;Man the Hunted&lt;/em&gt; that early humans evolved not as hunters but as preys of many predators. They studied the &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, which lived between 5 million and 2.5 million years ago and is one of the better-known early human species. It seems that they were small and strong like any other primates and that they mainly ate fruit and nuts. The point here is that &lt;strong&gt;they not only didn’t eat meat but that they were not even dentally prepared to eat it&lt;/strong&gt;. They &lt;em&gt;didn’t have sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods, so why would they hunt?&lt;/em&gt; Sussman and Hart’s anthropological studies show that it was not possible for early humans to consume meat until fire was controlled and cooking was possible, which it is dated to have happened only 800,000 years ago. “&lt;em&gt;In fact, some archaeologists and paleontologists don’t think we had a modern, systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60,000 years ago&lt;/em&gt;” said Sussman in an interview with Niel Schoenherr for &lt;em&gt;the Source&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn’t really seem fair to say that hunting is a part of human nature. So, how did we became hunters after living so long as prey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ker Than very well explains in his article for LiveScience: &lt;em&gt;“The theory of evolution by natural selection, first formulated in Darwin’s book On the Origin of Species in 1859, is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. &lt;strong&gt;Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and have more offspring&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;The Selfish Gene,&lt;/em&gt; Richard Dawkins explains very well what it means to be born a prey in a world where the only thing it matters is survival. Because I don’t think I would put it in better words, here is a piece of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;strong&gt;The currency used in the casino of evolution is survival&lt;/strong&gt;, strictly gene survival, but for many purposes individual survival is a reasonable approximation. If you go down to the water-hole to drink, you increase your risk of being eaten by predators who make their living lurking for prey by water-holes. If you do not go down to the water-hole you will eventually die of thirst. There are risks whichever way you turn, and you must take the decision that maximizes the long term survival chances of your genes. Perhaps the best policy is to postpone drinking until you are very thirsty, then go and have a good long drink to last you a long time. That way you reduce the number of separate visits to the water-hole, but you have to spend a long time with your head down when you finally do drink. Alternatively the best gamble might be to drink little and often, snatching quick gulps of water while running past the water-hole. Which is the best gambling strategy depends on all sorts of complex things, not least the hunting habit of the predator, which itself is evolved to be maximally efficient from their point of view. Some form of weighing up of the odds has to be done. But of course we do not have to think of animals as making the calculations consciously. All we have to believe is that &lt;strong&gt;those individuals whose genes build brains in such a way that they tend to gamble correctly are as a direct result more likely to survive, and therefore to propagate those same genes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know that, the same way other animals do, we survive through gambling. But, why is the human being so good at it? You are better at gambling when you are able, in a certain way, to predict the future. Animals are not born with this quality and humans, in general, aren’t natural clairvoyants. We are all born knowing nothing and then we learn. So the most common way for an animal to foresee the future is through their own experiences. An individual has to try a strategy which then will be revealed as good or bad or, as better or worse than the previous try. This way the individual, through gambling, will create a better strategy. &lt;strong&gt;But what happens when an individual has the capacity to simulate the future in a safe environment before trying it in real life?&lt;/strong&gt; That would make prey much more challenging for a hunter. Simulation, or better known as imagination, is a very human quality and the key to our survival. We build a possible scenario in our mind and we play the game over and over until we find a strategy safe enough for us to try. &lt;strong&gt;That’s what has actually made us stronger and more adaptable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most humans nowadays still don’t hunt and they can even live barely eating any meat. Our creative modern life allows us to produce plant-based substitutes and get them anywhere around the world in a matter of hours. Surely humanity has had rough times getting food and we had to resort to hunting. But, given our current situation where excessive meat production is threatening our species and ecosystem, it would make much more sense to find a brand new way of feeding ourselves that doesn’t imply killing or violence in any way. After all we already conquered the food chain. &lt;strong&gt;It is our turn to give something back to &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; using those amazing abilities to imagine that &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; gave to us in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The good and the bad marriage: is it really a matter of perspective?</title>
        <link>https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/the_good_and_the_bad_marriage/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_1722.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The good and the bad marriage: is it really a matter of perspective?" /&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-are-so-many-versions-of-marriage-that-i-had-to-make-up-my-own&#34;&gt;There are so many versions of marriage that I had to make up my own.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 25 years old when I got married to my high school sweetheart. At the time I thought I was too young to tie up myself for life. But I did it anyway because I had no doubts about my relationship. Some people told me that it was a good age to have kids, so I was doing the right thing. Other people congratulated me politely and didn’t really care what I did with my life. A few were very surprised that a young feminist like me decided to take such a step. I don’t know… I don’t think that marriage has nothing to do with age, kids or feminism. I think that history has given us very bad examples of marriage and now we seem to only look at it as good or bad. No human connection is that simple. No important topic of our life can be put that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder why feminism has hard feelings towards marriage but at the same time most people want to find the right person to have a serious relationship with. I do understand their arguments against the official union. Traditionally and still in many cultures, when a woman gets married goes from being the property of the father to be the property of her husband. There is no freedom there. One proof is the fact that she is being walked down the aisle by her father. In this scenario the woman isn’t making any decision; marriage is not her decision, it is an imposition. Luckily I got married in Spain and there we signed a different kind of contract. Both parties have the same rights and obligations making no difference between men and women so marriage is just a contract were you make official your serious relationship. You should not be losing anything, you just get whatever benefits the state gives to married people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don’t think I am in the position to talk about married in countries where women have no rights, I will stick to those aspects that have nothing to do with politics but they are related to the cultural beliefs running my nearest society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably start with the Disney fantasy that makes us feel that soulmates a real thing. Unfortunately when those two bags of DNA got together they were not thinking about your prince charming. They were just trying to bring one more human being into this world. If the gen combination doesn’t work, maybe next time it will. And that’s the same with soulmates. If “the one” doesn’t work, maybe next time it will. That’s why instead of talking about my soulmate I rather talk about my very best friend with enormous benefits. That way you get a more faithful picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tradition that has gotten lots of attention thanks to the romantic love concept shown in films is the engagement rings. Nowadays it seems like you can’t get engaged without a big stone in your finger. On the other hand it is more common the idea of seeing engagement rings as decorative handcuffs. To some people they represent the destruction of your autonomy and an agreement to put up with the whatever the future brings. I don’t see engagement rings as nothing else than a gift. You are going to ask someone to get married, it seems a good idea to me to pose the question with a nice present. In my case I was the one being asked, so I didn’t have to think about it. However my fiancé then, did. He didn’t understand the silly thing of having two rings, one pre and another post- wedding. So he refused the idea of buying me an engagement ring. What he did was to watch me during a few weeks until he realised that I needed a watch and kept on postponing to buy one. Better than an expensive gift is a functional gift, not because it’s useful but because it shows an effort from his part. You know that person really understands you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you are engaged and the money worries come. You have an expensive wedding to organise and on top of that, you know that the couple never enjoys the party… I just don’t understand why the fact that you want to get married means that you have to make a big party. Every couple should have the freedom to decide and if a picnic suits better your pocket, then it should be a picnic. Actually I will raise the offer. Make it a small gathering with your five closest friends and have a lovely honey moon camping. That was in real life my first idea, then I had to admit that I had chosen a party lover and that I couldn’t mess around with the best day of his life. So I end up doing a huge party, but that was my decision made with total freedom. And yeah… I did have lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having fun during your wedding is also important. Struggling to make a fabulous party and then having only stressful memories it’s a total waste of time. If you enjoy organising events, go for it. Do your best job and be proud of it, but that day you just have to agree to some mess to happen. Remember that it is not what life throws at you but the attitude you chose to wear when you confront it. So if someone smashes the cake on the groom’s face make sure you are there to have a bite out of your sweet sweet spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve survived the wedding. Your pictures are awesome and you just moved a new wonderful house. Oh, oh… Were you to living together before getting married? It’s definitely not a requirement for a peaceful marriage but it will give you a hint of how your relationship is actually doing before jumping into the water. I don’t think it’s necessary to share the living space more than a year, but signing a cohabitation agreement before giving it a try… well, it just seems a little bit too much like romantic love to me. Hey, maybe you two can get away with marriage and not living in the same house. Why not, anything that is good for you two it is good for the couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sing those papers you automatically become a family. I guess that’s why so many people assume that I was getting married to have children. I am going to be honest and tell you that I did feel a bit obligated to have children, only for a few seconds, though, every time that someone mentioned it. Lots of times. When I got married I had no idea if I wanted to have children or not. For god sake, I am 28 years old, and I am still thinking about it. That’s a problem right there. If you really want to have children and you just pick the first available person in line you are likely to make a mistake. And if you get married for love and then have children, maybe also for love (it wouldn’t be the first time), of course you are going to hate your marriage and your partner and your live. That’s what happens when we do things that we don’t really want to do: just plain unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s when unhappiness appears that you wonder which kind of ending you got. Perhaps you were counting on a clean road after your wedding, and some holes appeared that you are just not able to fill. You are in front of the mirror and you don’t know who you are looking at any more. Or is it your partner who seems to have changed more than you thought it was possible? If your are worried that your are not going to get a happy ending, don’t worry: marriage has no happy ending, your significant other is going to leave you one way or another. It can be a break up or a car accident, or he/she might peacefully die just when you feel most vulnerable in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good for you both to keep in mind that that’s the life you have chosen and not the only life you can have. If you understand this you will enjoy every moment and you will run away soon enough whenever it’s necessary. Remember when I said that anything that is good for you two it is good for the couple? Well, it is still true, but there is a hard true to it that you may not like it: divorce. We all make mistakes but we still deserve to go on with our life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the question still remains. Why the fuck would you want to get married?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know when you feel that you disappointed someone many times and also you have used your worst manners to hurt that person deeply but nothing seems to drive that person away. And the weirdest thing is that he or she forgets all those things and help you to be a better version of yourself, not in a manipulative way, but with compassion and understanding. You know, growing up together, helping each other to become more mature, supporting each other through dark times and all that shit. I know, I know, it sound very much like a friendship. But I like to think of it like a friendship that everybody needs and most people can’t live without. Sure, marriage doesn’t give you that, but if you have it, why not to get married?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is we often have a lot more patience with our friends than with our partners. We expect them to be there for us anytime and we get angry if they aren’t but we regularly forget that we should also be willing to live through out their crazy mood. Being compassionate it has always being difficult, nowadays even more since you get constantly reinforced by the social media of how special you are. But we should try and, consciously, make the decision to choose to love your significant other every single day. If that is not what you want to choose to do, then you haven’t found your “very best friend with enormous benefits”. Or… you still need to grow up, which means you need someone to help you and support you in those very dark times. So, why don’t we try to be nice to each other and every now and then, maybe when you are not completely sure about your arguments, just give in for the common good. At the end of the day, marriage is and has always been a business contract. Buy a ring or throw a party to celebrate your business if you want. But please, be nice to your business partner and I assure you you will get those enormous benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-poem-about-the-past&#34;&gt;A poem about the past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tired from last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakfast doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through my irritated gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I throw up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ready for the bus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to pick me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to sleep but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have things to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the bully will strike,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and no one will hear me shout,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even in a crowded playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to come back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to a home where I can cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I found a house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where no one would hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for me to grow up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I just learned how to add and subtract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again comes the night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with another fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother is angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because my father is drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatigue is settling in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am no longer a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, hey, at the end of the day,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today, I survived.&lt;/p&gt;
