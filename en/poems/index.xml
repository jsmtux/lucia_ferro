      <description>A poem that, in my head, it&amp;rsquo;s jazz Photo taken by Lucia Ferro It’s Monday,
and you’re already done.
It’s Monday,
and you’ve had enough.
Four days
seem too much,
but you don&amp;rsquo;t know
what would they hide.
A shiny cold day
or a pleasant lunch.
It&amp;rsquo;s Monday,
what a bad start.
You&amp;rsquo;ve judged the week
before you&amp;rsquo;ve tried
to look for moments
that make worthy lifes.
They turn dark clouds</description>

      <description>A new perspective on an old concept The Netherlands. Photo taken by Lucía Ferro. The world feels big.
Big like the desert when you just leave the oasis.
Chaos burns full of entropy
like the skin of my feet
stepping on boiling sand bathed with dry heat.
I cannot bare any more
the details of this reality.
I want to be drowsy and bored
with some soothing fantasy.
But this strong and wild and feverish curiosity</description>

      <description>A poem about friendship Photo: Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s air by Lucía Ferro I was feeling numb when they came.
No emotions or a flame.
They started to chat,
and I listen to them.
There was no anger
in what they said.
No envy, no revenge.
I was confused in a sense.
Why didn&amp;rsquo;t they complain?
Life isn&amp;rsquo;t fair,
and everybody feels some pain.
Later I came to learn
that all those bloody blades,</description>

      <description>A poem about compassion Switzerland, photo taken by the author We think we are brilliant
when we see others’ wrong side.
We treat them rough;
we ignore their shine.
As if life wasn’t hard enough,
we forget to note when they’re right.
And that’s what we’ve become:
Judges of the weak and fragile.
We feel strong and tough.
We forget our own troubled times
without which we wouldn’t have seen the light.</description>

      <description>Machines creating wonderful things Photo by Compare Fibre on Unsplash We look at this piece of meat
like a bunch of iron hinges, wood and wheels.
We don&amp;rsquo;t see a body.
Instead, we see a machine.
We misuse it
letting our blood run free.
Our sweat.
Our fluids.
We perceive them as waste.
We even feel ashamed.
As if they were a sign of our character weakening.
Why do we so often forget</description>

      <description>A poem to patience in friendship Photo by Lucía Ferro Don&amp;rsquo;t you dare break into my soul
looking for gems that can be sold
to warm yourself up when it&amp;rsquo;s cold
and forget about me when you find a clear road.
Indeed, I do set a high prize
for those who want to see my inside,
but you have to understand
so many times has it been vandalized!
that loneliness feels safer than being advised</description>

      <description>A poem fueled with indignation Photo by Andrik Langfield on Unsplash I feel judged by the lot
when I am trying to be more.
More of myself.
More of the woman I left
behind when I was surviving,
and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for thriving.
But now I do.
I revise my behaviour and my childhood
and I find terrible things,
but sometimes, I also find it.
My authenticity.
So why do they judge me?</description>

      <description>A poem with disappointment Photo by Enrico Da Prato on Unsplash You, with me, were there
when the monsters yelled.
Under the sheets
hiding from darkness and scared,
you and I, trembling through a nightmare.
You talked about dreams so I would forget
we were children living in hell.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t feel safe, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone,
or so I thought
until time made you grow.
You grew bigger, not wiser; I realised</description>

      <description>The Dark Night Of The Soul Eindhoven by Lucía Ferro I see myself
over and over
at the bottom
of a well.
The water
keeps raising.
My chest
keeps aching.
I take
my last breath
and the water
covers my head.
But the air
I exhale
creates a bubble
of pain.
And I feed
on the pain,
becoming the fuel
of my internal duel.
Oh, the fight
it elevates me high</description>

      <description>A poem about the past Photo: Simple wild life by Lucía Ferro I woke up
tired from last night.
The breakfast doesn&amp;rsquo;t go down
through my irritated gut.
I am nauseous.
I throw up,
ready for the bus
to pick me up.
I sit alone.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to chat.
I want to sleep but
I have things to think about.
Today the bully will strike,
and no one will hear me shout,</description>
