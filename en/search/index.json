[{"content":"No artificial intelligence will overtake art. Photo by Bárbara Fróes on Unsplash\nIt is the honest message what IAs lack. A person can hide behind a ton of microchips and wires but that won\u0026rsquo;t cover a desperate seek for attention or an unsatisfied need for bread. An artist, however, can communicate those same desires, and gift us all with a life lesson that puts one more stone on the history of our civilization.\nYou can give an excellent description in natural language as input to the AI and still, you will be asked for an explanation. Otherwise, why would there be a canvas with a single black dot in a prestigious museum?\nThe history behind the artist gives meaning to the work of art, without context, there is no story to tell. When we look at a picture we don\u0026rsquo;t only wonder what the message is but also what did make the artist think that way. Every human being has good reason to come up to a conclusion. Sometimes, the path is obvious because we\u0026rsquo;ve seen it many times (like an AI interpolating ideas from a bucket of data) but when we come across an original idea we know there is some unusual life story behind it. It is not only the message that matters, it is also the intention with which it was delivered, too. We often discuss the intention behind the message when talking about comedy. It is in fact what drives the whole debate about the limits of comedy, a fine line between making someone laugh or offending them. In the same way, it matters if the creator was trying to tell something meaningful or trying to sell you some stuff. If you are smart you probably avoid watching as many ads as possible, and it is understandable. Very few ads have any artistic value, most of them are plain manipulative videos prepared to break your will and interfere with your self-control. \u0026ldquo;Art\u0026rdquo; made by an IA will likely be superficial. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even call it art. I find it arrogant to apply such a deep concept to something that has no soul. They are images, sure. Art, no. Beauty is forged with imperfection. Surely AIs are trying to emulate this therefore chances are you might encounter a beautiful image made by artificial intelligence that can trick you into believing is being made by humans. But why would you give any value to that? Well, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t, and the explanation is very simple. It is the same reason why you don\u0026rsquo;t toss that damaged photo cut out of an old magazine and have no problems donating a perfectly brand-new print that got left in the apartment you just moved into. I dare to say, the quality of the image is much better, the imperfections have been well emulated and you can\u0026rsquo;t even tell is not a real painting. Still, you prefer the cut-out picture. Images and their by-products might lower their prices like it happens today with everyday objects. There is no denying that, we all know that aggressive capitalism will devour anything that can be produced in an assembly line. But the same way, we all know that a set of cutlery from Ikea has no art value apart from a tiny spot in the minimalist style that, surprise, surprise, capitalism loves. Art is priceless because it transits our spirits and leaves a print that we can only explain to ourselves. It has always been about the story.\nPerhaps we are about yo regress back to a time when the ability of inspiring meaning in people\u0026rsquo;s imagination was all the art there was, yet art will continue to be human because humanity resides within its meaning. Perhaps, we will turn into bards making up stories about images just to catch a few coins. To be honest, we already do it. We take pictures with camera phones filled with AI and we upload them for a few likes. But do you dare to call yourself a photographer?\nAI, the final resource Ultimately, art is the expression of human creativity and imagination. Any experienced artist knows that an excess of resources does not make the labour of art any easier, but more challenging instead. In order to escape ennui, a man either works beyond the extent of his former necessities, or he invents play, that is to say, work that is only intended to appease the general necessity for work. He who has become satiated with play, and has no new necessities impelling him to work, is sometimes attacked by the longing for a third state, which is related to play as gliding is to dancing, as dancing is to walking, a blessed, tranquil movement; it is the artists’ and philosophers’ vision of happiness. — Nietzche\nThis paragraph, taken from Nietzche\u0026rsquo;s book Human, All-Too-Human, pretends to show us a way to the happiness of the artist. As creativity and imagination are part of our human condition, I think we can assume it applies to everybody to some degree. Nietzche used to say that we must dance in chains, meaning we cannot have total freedom because restrictions are the muses that inspire us. When aspiring artists sit down to think about what to create, they often blame their inability to perform on not having enough resources. AI, as the final helper, has the potential to give us that infinite range of options we often think are the cause of our failure. The truth is, some of the most appreciated works of art have been made with very little, and it is precisely the fact that the artist was so constrained that made their art so valuable. Artificial Intelligence will never have the juice that powered the tormented artist or the hopeful one that imagines a world where no one has gone before, simply because it can\u0026rsquo;t have irrational emotions. Photo by Raimond Klavins on Unsplash\nMaybe AI will overflow the market. We want to have what others have. Be owners and inspire jealousy. Have an unreal sense of protection. All of that leads us to cherish only what falls into conformity and safe social standards that promise a certainty that, sorry to disappoint you, does not exist. Look at how cities are designed. They are ugly even when they have a few green areas, but hey, they have very functional buildings with little apartments where to house many workers, who, at this rate, won\u0026rsquo;t even be considered human; only useless cattle that became endangered species just like donkeys were replaced by trucks. We\u0026rsquo;ve left Gaudi as an architect of the past as if we didn\u0026rsquo;t need more beauty in the present. No wonder we are sure an AI is going to overtake the arts. We are not appreciating the effort the artist has put into it, we are only thinking of getting a sample for ourselves. But decoration and marketing design has nothing to do with art. There is a huge gap in between in which human particularities thrive for their uniqueness. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the difference, I encourage you to look for it. And if you refuse to acknowledge that area of our existence, well, I simply pity you and wish you good luck. ","date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/barbara-froes-Yhsdub0hV1A-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/ai_art/","title":"What's the difference between a human artist and an image generator AI"},{"content":"I want to disappear.\nNot forever, only for a little while. I want to be invisible, but still, walk around.

I definitely am. We cannot go to the supermarket and avoid plastics, because they are literally everywhere. It\u0026rsquo;s a challenge to reduce our carbon footprint if we need to travel and the only affordable option still comes as a flight ticket. We cannot hope to stop children\u0026rsquo;s and adults\u0026rsquo; slavery when a t-shirt cannot realistically be made for 2$. How am I supposed to succumb to fashion trends and posturing on social media if I don\u0026rsquo;t have a new set of clothes every now and then?\nShould we walk around naked? I am not the kind who often goes shopping, but I understand this is a common hobby for many people, especially, if you are interested in performative arts and styling. And for a bunch more, it all comes to keeping a decent look for work or society in general. So, even if I would like a world where we all wear sweatpants and holey shirts, I understand the need for businesses that provide cute, fancy and elegant clothes.\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that we start to actually have some available options when it comes to shopping apart from the traditional second-hand shops popularised by charities. Those are vintage shops and circular brands.\nVintage shops Photo by Clem Onojeghuo on Unsplash\nFirst thing, yes, in a vintage shop you buy second-hand items. But here is the difference. In a vintage shop, you only find clothes in good condition. What does that mean for the consumer? You don\u0026rsquo;t need to go through kilos and kilos of wool and cotton of questionable quality. A vintage shop is often run by someone who puts attention to choosing these clothes so you can trust their quality. Not only that, but they are usually people who have a special liking for fashion and they would provide a consistent style in their boutique. This consistency in style is often the reason why people keep going back to the same shop.\nCircular brands Photo by Noah Buscher on Unsplash\nDo you know what can you do with a T-shirt you bought on Primark after a year or two of use? A cleaning cloth. This kind of fabric has very little lifespan and the best thing you can get out of it is some sort of mince to fill pillows with. However, when a brand takes responsibility, they create clothes that will last and that can be recycled into new pieces if their integrity is compromised. Some of them even give you a percentage of their value if you bother to send it back to them. This way, the amount of waste that gets to the overflow landfills is instantly reduced.\nThese circular brands have even gotten into the second-hand business creating a platform within their online shops to easily trade their brand clothes. This might seem counterintuitive as they offer you the chance to buy from someone else a piece of garment that otherwise you would be buying for full price to them. But they know, in an eco-friendly future, this would eventually happen and they simply decided to be the ones taking a small commission out of it. This helps the consumer, too, because you won\u0026rsquo;t have to be searching for hours to find that particular jacket you liked but you could not afford to buy new. You\u0026rsquo;ll have now the opportunity to find it in the same place you saw it for the first time.\nWhy are these businesses destroying the current fashion industry? Simply because the current fashion industry doesn\u0026rsquo;t really want you to trade. They certainly don\u0026rsquo;t want you to trade at a cheaper price than they do. Brands need to keep on selling new products, they cannot stop selling new stuff, otherwise, their company\u0026rsquo;s benefits will suffer. Circular brands understand that our economy cannot support such a type of business much longer and they are willing to adapt to a new future. Traditional fashion brands still see much profit to be gained by polluting our world. The best solution they\u0026rsquo;ve come up with is to buy some ocean plastic (which they\u0026rsquo;ve put there in the first place) and turn it into their \u0026ldquo;special model of the year\u0026rdquo; in hopes of getting some good publicity that will allow them to confidently sell more of the bad-quality high-contaminating but cheaper products they produce (which will ultimately end up in the same garbage patch they claim to clean).\nSometimes, we do have a choice Photo by Victoriano Izquierdo on Unsplash\nLike most people, I tend to get frustrated by the current state of the world. It might not be news, the world has always had its flaws, but our daily exposure to information makes me feel much more bothered by it than ignorance would. That is the dark side of knowledge, once you know, you cannot unknow. That it\u0026rsquo;s why we have to use the little power we still have to make decisions that matter. We cannot give away our energy doing the impossible thing to fight a systemic issue because we would surely fall back into frustration, but we can support those who take the risk of challenging the system that gave them success, changing their ways in pursuit of a better world.\n","date":"2023-04-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/angela-bailey-jlo7Bf4tUoY-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/businesses_destroying_fashion_industry/","title":"These two businesses types are destroying the current fashion industry (for our sake)"},{"content":"A book that makes no sense so it can make sense of life. Indeed, it’s not a recent book, but it is still very necessary. You’ve might have heard of it or even read it in 1989. If you haven’t, it doesn’t matter, you can enjoy this piece anyway as I have selected a few passages that you can read along the article.\nHere is a summary of the book.\nMost readers wonder why Barnes has written a collection of stories that have very little in common, and yet, create a composition in itself thanks to those cues he dropped along the way. Some considered it a boastful moment, the performance of an egomaniac impulse, the showing off of his writing skills. Though there might be some truth in it, I think that was not his major objective.\nOf course, he wanted to attract some attention. That is for sure, as it seems to be the flaw and virtue of any writer. But he did not want to catch that attention only to please himself. I believe he had a message to deliver, a message that we humans refuse to hear. A delicate subject that is bigger than any debate.\nBarnes spends most pages remodelling history, reinterpreting it or even adding new perspectives to it. At first glimpse, it might seem like a disdain for history, but it is far from it. ly finds it not only fascinating but entertaining. Most disciplines become tedious once you go deep into the matter. However, history offers you plenty of easily digestible stories enjoyable to anyone no matter their knowledge or particular likes.\nWhen the seven of us climbed out of that ram’s horn, we were euphoric. We had survived. We had stowed away, survived and escaped — all without entering into any fishy covenants with either God or Noah. We had done it by ourselves. We felt ennobled as a species. That might strike you as comic, but we did: we felt ennobled. That Voyage taught us a lot of things, you see, and the main thing was this: that man is a very unevolved species compared to the animals. We don’t deny, of course, your cleverness, your considerable potential. But you are, as yet at an early stage of your development. We, for instance, are always ourselves: that is what it means to be evolved. We are what we are, and we know what that is. You don’t expect a cat suddenly to start barking, do you, or a pig to start lowing? But this is what, a manner of speaking, those of us who made the Voyage on the Ark learned to expect from your species. One moment you bark, one moment you mew; one moment you wish to be wild, one moment you wish to be tame. You knew where you were with Noah only in this one respect: that you never knew where you were with him.\n—Chapter 1: The stowaway; A History of the World in 10½ Chapters by Julian Barnes (1989)\nBarnes shows history as the weapon it is. A weapon used to justify cruelty or any other impulses men can have. And that is why it matters who is telling the story (history) because whether someone has a clear agenda or not, they are going to have a subconscious one.\nHis view of history can also apply to the present, and especially, to the communication field. We are experiencing political polarization, wars that don’t seem to find an end because whoever is giving orders is not willing to change their perspectives, not even an inch.\n“That you never knew where you were with him” is the unsettling feeling millions of people have nowadays. We looked at the future and we see “Noahs” telling us stories about what will be of us, but all we know for certain is that we cannot trust them.\nA close and recent example of England (Barnes’ home country) is Brexit; millions of people voted for an imaginary future based on a history that never happened. But politicians know very well how little reality matters, when it comes to convincing people, all that matters is emotions. And stories are definitely the best way to get there.\nOften enough, reviews have pointed out the interest of Julian Barnes in history and the preoccupation with love in his work. However, I would include truth in the cocktail if we really want to dig deeper into the meaning of this work of art.\nYou aren’t too good with the truth, either, your species. You keep forgetting things, or you pretend to. The loss of Varaldi and his ark — does anyone speak of that? I can see there might be a positive side to this wilful averting of the eye: ignoring the bad things makes it easier for you to carry on. But ignoring the bad things makes you end up believing that bad things never happen. You are always surprised by them. It surprises you that guns kill, that money corrupts, that snow falls in winter. Such naivety can be charming; alas, it can also be perilous.\n—Chapter 1: The stowaway; A History of the World in 10½ Chapters by Julian Barnes (1989)\nIf we think of him just as a writer, we can infer a love for stories, which is how he sees history and possibly why he’s chosen to bring historical events into his narrative. He doesn’t give much importance to the details and doesn’t care if they are believable or not, for that he’s chosen to tell his first chapter from the perspective of a woodworm. Instead, he worries about the implications of the moral. He doesn’t do this by proving a new one, nor he pretends to lay out alternative teaching. He simply states the little reliability of any story, and therefore, of history.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if he is not entirely confident about his ideas and so he rather leaves the conclusions to the readers, perhaps he even enjoys listening to whatever people have reflected about his hieroglyphics.\nThis lack of guidance, this refusal to clearly say what he wants you to think, I found it to be a sign of modesty. Personally, I am tired of reading texts that point me in a direction and threaten me if I dare to look around in search of any other options. You only have to read the comments section of any current topics to see that considering other possibilities is pretty much synonymous with treason. Not national treason per se, but personal treason for sure.\nLove and truth, that’s the vital connection, love and truth. Have you ever told so much truth as when you were first in love? Have you ever seen the world so clearly? Love makes us see the truth, makes it our duty to tell the truth. Lying in bed: listen to undertow of working in that phrase. Lying in bed, we tell the truth: it sounds like a paradoxical sentence from a first-year philosophy primer. But it’s more (and less) than that: a description of moral duty. Don’t roll that eyeball, give a flattering groan, fake that orgasm. Tell the truth with your body even if — especially if — that truth is not melodramatic. Bed is one of the prime places where you can lie without getting caught, where you can holler and grunt in the dark and later boast about your “performance”. Sex isn’t acting (however much we admire our own script); sex is about truth. How you cuddle in the dark governs how you see the history of the world. It’s as simple as that.\n—Chapter 8½: Parenthesis; A History of the World in 10½ Chapters by Julian Barnes (1989)\nIf you ask me, that half chapter called Parenthesis is why Julian Barnes has written the other ten. He needed elaborate examples that would open up people’s minds and prepare them for what he had to say. Again, he didn’t want to give a clear conclusion about love, but you can see he feels much stronger about this subject than others. Though we all do, one way or another.\nJulian Barnes compares history and love, and he does that by redefining truth.\nWe all have our own history, we all tell our preferable stories, and we all love someone despite our worlds can never be met. Truth doesn’t exist which means putting too much emotion into it won’t get us closer to any existential answer or any kind of success. However, unconditional love, that love that acknowledges our differences and doesn’t try to change the other to meet our particular point of view is what will allow us to remain together as a society. That we can learn in our relationships, and hopefully transfer to our society.\nWe can only hope our loved ones will gravitate towards a truth that will allow us all to be free, but we cannot do much about it behalf telling them our favourite stories. Some will use this opportunity to manipulate, and this way they will stain the name of love for many; and some others will use it to open windows to those who sit behind the high walls of indoctrination.\nNow more than ever, being aware of the feebleness of history is crucial. We cannot trust those who tell us stories out of their own emotional baggage while we cannot forget the emotional baggage that most societies carry which must be addressed in other to heal. Extremely complicated subject for only 309 pages. And so the question remains.\nWhat is love?\nWhat is truth?\nAnd what history should we listen to?\n","date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/julianbarnes.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/julianbarnes/","title":"Lessons about Love and Truth in 10½ Chapters"},{"content":"The revolution of care This weekend I had the pleasure and opportunity to be part of the International Feminist Gathering in Madrid. I arrived there overwhelmed by the number of people I encountered and left with a bag full of teachings and hope for the future. Yes, you’ve read it well, I said hope. When we think of feminism we often think of angry women complaining about the gender gap or violence, but feminism has engulfed not only patriarchy’s consequences but also its causes. This means that we are addressing the route of various problems unifying people in a single social movement that aims to ensure a dignified life for everybody taking their differences into consideration. For more than 24 hours we listened to great thinkers like American philosopher Judith Butler redefining the analysing of the current situation of feminism; scientist Vandana Shiva talking about the climate crisis and how it affects women and racialized people the most; Argentina’s Spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti highlighting the struggle we confronted to win abortion rights, and even more, to keep them; or Nicaraguan journalist Patricia Orozco stressing the importance of unpaid labour — care of children, dependent people and household — as the sustaining element of our society’s ground.\nAnd that’s where the fourth feminist wave is heading: CARE. Our current socioeconomic system only considers that something is generated when the outcome of the work done is money. It doesn’t matter which means are necessary or the side effects. Only a number followed by the symbol of a coin is valued. Within the feminist movement, it has been proposed to redesign the current system to achieve a community focused on people in contraposition to the production-based society we are experiencing. In other words, instead of focusing on generating productivity, we would be concentrating our efforts on generating equality and well-being. They have also raised concerns about the widespread idea that the economy seems to be understood only from a neoliberal perspective. We find proof of it in public debates that don’t allocate time to discuss the alternatives. Also, as evidence of its neglect, we often see the lack of resources to both educate and investigate those other economic systems that walk away from perpetual growth and fixate their actions on sustainability. The political and economic scientist Maria Ángeles Durán has stated that neoliberalism leaves very little space in conversations for other types of economy. Capitalism has monopolized university classrooms burying all alternatives. But, fortunately, not everybody has fallen prey to such orchestrated deception. Durán managed to push the research on other types of economic systems and arrived at a conclusion:\nOur current economy studies the scarce goods and gives them a price, now we propose an alternative economy that would study what can’t be given a price.\nShe was talking again about breeding, upbringing and care, the cornerstones of capitalism, a civil religion that wouldn’t be possible without healthy and educated people available to work for those businesses and corporations that claim to sustain our communities.\nEcofeminism has warned us all of the inevitable degrowth we are already undergoing which won’t be resolved as resources are limited and sequestrated by only a few. Yayo Herrero (anthropologist, engineer and professor) has given a very clear message:\n“The degrowth of the materialistic realm of the economy is not an option but a piece of information, is there and it’s happening (…) Whether we like it or not, the majority of humans on this planet are going to live with less energy, fewer materials and fewer land resources, simply due to a matter of translimitation…”\nWe are running out of time for technology to do its magic. We need to support whatever scientific developments we can achieve with a revolutionary social change, otherwise, we’ll keep facing disturbing situations like the fact that fertile-aged women in México are showing health-threatening chemicals in their breast milk due to the elevated use of pesticides that intensive agriculture and other forms of extractivism require. The persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can be transferred through the placenta and breast milk to the developing human offspring, literally, the future of humanity. Feminism is not a fight against men. It’s a fight against the patriarchal system, a fight against the establishment that would actually benefit everybody. The fourth feminist wave sees care not only as the economic empowerment of women but as the civilizing act that reorganizes society and fosters violence prevention leading us towards a peaceful future. The feminist revolution of care has begun and we should all be excited about it. ","date":"2023-02-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/feministrevolution.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/feminist_revolution_care/","title":"The feminist agenda for the years to come"},{"content":"They told me I was wrong when I only asked a question We have to stop pretending we understand the matter to its full extent and stop calling people TERFs, fascists or transhumanists at the first sign of disagreement.\nMost people are just confused about what gender means and what its relationship is with social roles. I would even dare to say that there are as many definitions of gender as opinions on the matter, which makes the discussion not only difficult but often even absurd.\nEnough people don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge that sex and gender are different things. Some think both are just human inventions while others think that gender is a \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; condition inseparable from sex. Perspectives that bend the debate to the breaking point.\nWhile one is a scientific term that cannot be changed as DNA cannot be changed, the other is a social concept subjected to a whole cultural background that varies with time and geography.\nWhat is the point of two people arguing about gender if one of them believes it to be just the same as sex and the other considers it more of a feeling? Clearly, there won\u0026rsquo;t be any shared ground there to arrive at a common conclusion.\nEvery time I read an article about this matter I only read the words written in a presumptuous way, teaching people about their beliefs as if they were facts set into stone.\nI found it very interesting when two people who\u0026rsquo;ve struggled with dysphoria are calling each other on their supposed brainwashed behaviours. You cannot say they have no experience in the matter and at the same time they can very much differ in opinion. They don\u0026rsquo;t even listen to each other they assume the other person must be wrong because they see things in a different light.\nYou would say that this is a matter to be discussed and defined by whoever is affected by it, in other words, by the LGBT community. I will go ahead and say that I think it needs to be led by LGBT people but they cannot be the only ones in the discussion.\nThose who fall into the traditional picture of gender can\u0026rsquo;t ignore the subject either as plenty of people has a family member or a friend who struggles with some sort of dysphoria. If you want to be a good parent or a good friend you need to be in it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think we can even pick a side in the debate, as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have two sides. There are plenty of perspectives to choose from, and whoever thinks there is only one way to understand it, they\u0026rsquo;ve just given themselves away showing how nescient they are.\nSome people argue that there has always been a Trans community. I get that there has always been a community that challenged social standards and expressed themselves independently of what they were told they should be doing by their culture. I know that homosexuality was normalised until it was not (unfairly and violently), as there are plenty of historical references that reinforce this idea.\nBut, you cannot say that there have always been people that undergo a great number of surgeries and treatments to shape their bodies so they can fit the opposite sex\u0026rsquo;s cultural standards because the first cases date from the early 20th century, about 100 years ago.\nI find this distinction very relevant to the debate because many disagreements are generated by the dichotomy that generates favouring or rejecting all the surgical treatment that today is offered.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not what I think, you are wrong We have people on the most extremist edges of the discussion like fascists who just want us to follow their view of the world with little imagination. But then, they are not really in the debate as they refuse to listen and they don\u0026rsquo;t actually give any valid arguments. And even if they, by any chance, happened to address a genuine problem in the system, they do it from such a raging place that they end up saying nothing anyway.\nIn the same way, those who don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge and blindly ignore any effects that sex reassignment surgery might have on both the physical and mental health of the individual; might come across as someone who jumps clueless into a fashion, as they defend what seems a progressive idea but without having doing any reasoning.\nWhen I look at the various views I find truth in most of them. Which makes this debate very entertaining but at the same time very frustrating.\nGender, a social construct These are people who find gender as an outrageous idea that our society should have never adopted. This theory considers that the notion of masculinity and femininity have been implemented to better control people, and to uniform society to suit those in power. You can say it makes sense as most individuals can\u0026rsquo;t really be placed in those \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; boxes creating much distress on the average person who keeps on trying to fit the expectations of their gender.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s not so simple, because, within this category, you find more disagreements.\nIf gender is a social construct why are there people putting so much effort into redesigning their bodies or getting uncomfortable because they have been misgendered during a conversation? And if gender is a social construct why don\u0026rsquo;t we treat it at a different level than biological sex?\nGender abolition Some people just want to erase gender completely. They don\u0026rsquo;t want it mentioned anywhere in hopes that would bring equality for everybody.\nIn this case, they often keep the concept of (biological) sex but don\u0026rsquo;t associate any psychological behaviours with it. This means they refuse the idea of female/male brains which is manifested by men and women engaging in any kind of activity that suits them.\nIt sounds great. Simple, easily digested. Even harmless. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give an answer to certain aspects such as gender dysphoria which is quite a theme in itself, or the huge impact that hormones have on our mood, and behaviours by extension.\nTrans Anyone who dares to talk about trans should be very familiar with the term gender dysphoria, as it is the first sign that a human shows when there is something going on regarding their gender.\n\u0026ldquo;Gender dysphoria is a psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd one more question arises:\nIs this incongruence a consequence of an abusive society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow any human expression outside of the \u0026ldquo;norm\u0026rdquo; or does the cause lies more in a feeling that pushes the person to reject their own body?\nAs a former health professional trying to help and understand a community that experiences much psychological suffering, I find this a mystery. And honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone has the solution to this puzzle. Not yet, anyway.\nOn one hand, there are numerous testimonies from people glad to have transitioned that make me think that this is just a step forward to eventually fulfilling the purpose of the human rights declaration.\nOn the other hand, there are also plenty of testimonies from people who are regretful to have done it and feel not only disappointed with the decision that they\u0026rsquo;ve made, but betrayed by the health professionals that assisted them during that time.\nThis is why I cannot have a fixed opinion about it. Taking one\u0026rsquo;s side seems like disrespecting the other. The experience of one person doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any less true the experience of the other.\nThen, there are those who stay in between, trying to indulge their identity dreams but putting the breaks on mistreating their body too much. They get to experience the absence of gender expressing themselves in whatever way they need to, but they still experience sexuality based on the restrictions that might come with their biological sex. They have no aspirations for cis passing which means they confront an immense amount of homophobia.\nWhat is clear and seems to be a pattern is the neglected mental health of whoever has to go through this experience, and I am not talking about the subject in particular, but more about the professionals and relatives that surround the individual, and chose to give physical solutions to a particular distress that is mainly psychological. These physical solutions can be as simple as recommending people to dress \u0026ldquo;discretely\u0026rdquo; or they can go as far as surgical or chemical treatment. But they rarely are accompanied by a set of psychological tools to fight against abuse, to set boundaries or even to investigate our upbringing.\nHow can anybody make the right decisions about their own life if they are constantly bombarded with the opinion of others, with solutions that haven\u0026rsquo;t been proven or with a cocktail of chemicals (not only hormones but also antidepressants)? Even if that is the life they want to pursue, they will need to be in very good shape to confront the mental load that such changes bring with them.\nLGBT lobby For quite a while I wondered who the hell was this LGBT lobby that homophobic people uses to argue about the dangers of the LGBT community. I could not understand where the money was. Everybody can agree, or at least I do, that LGBT people deal with much discrimination in the job market, and therefore there are not really big businesses that favour them.\nThough my point of view regarding this hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed that much, I did learn that there might actually be a lobby profiting at the expense of this debate. And that is not a cowboy in leather pants and a colourful hat, neither is a diva showing off amazing vocal skills in a shiny dress and a synthetic wig. It is actually a lobby that is creating problems all over our society: the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry.\nThis industry doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an opinion about what you want to do with your life, instead, they only think about expanding their business. When they see a dysphoric person they see a customer, no matter which process decides to follow they will guide them in such a way the industry will make the biggest profit. You can see this pattern in other industries. Think for a minute about the minimalist movement. People join because they want to generate less rubbish and be more conscious, and still, the industry managed to turn it into a perfect excuse to buy new stylish furniture.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has shown before that, if it is possible, they try that you stay attached to them as long as possible, dependent for life would be perfect, just as a chronic patient.\nIf I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen it with my own eyes while I was working at the hospital I would consider it to be another conspiracy theory, but I did watch the jaws of this industry for eight years. I witness how easy it is for a doctor to prescribe fourteen tablets to a patient in a minute but it is nearly impossible for them to find fourteen minutes to listen to any patient. In these conditions, no wonder our mental health is so neglected. This is actually an issue that touches many areas of our lives, not only our gender identities or sexualities but our life as human beings in itself.\nGender creation: Non-binary Earlier I mentioned gender abolition and now comes the other side of the coin: People who don\u0026rsquo;t refuse the idea of gender but don\u0026rsquo;t identify with any of the traditional genders, and so a blank space in between is created. I totally relate to this even though I don\u0026rsquo;t identify as non-binary.\nWho are you if you like glitter, loose clothes, ballet and football?\nWho are you if you wear makeup, nail polish and a bear too?\nWho are you if you do your hair in order to be comfortable but don\u0026rsquo;t care about what message it gives?\nWho are you if you like both romance and action movies? Are rude or are you soft?\nWho are you if you enjoy musicals and gore? Are you joyful or tough?\nWho are you if you shop without looking at the big men/women signs hanging from the roof?\nI really get why this label has been invented though I don\u0026rsquo;t really like how it sounds. It seems like non-binary is just a label for whoever is fucking tired of absurd comments, tired of caring about what other people think about them. Exhausted and unable any more to listen to any unconstructive critics. Think about it, you just say \u0026ldquo;I am non-binary\u0026rdquo; and then the irritating conversations about what you should be doing about your looks are done. More or less what a guy with incipient alopecia does when he finally shaves his head off so people just call him bald, but at least, they stop telling him to book a trip to Turkey. As I said, I don\u0026rsquo;t like how it sounds. I would suggest a better name with a wider range of possibilities, something more like, non-fucks-to-give.\nIntersex Here is a factual, tangible and very much ignored reality: the intersexual children that grow in uncertainty, or worse, in oblivious, until they become old enough to confront their situation by themselves. At this point, it can be an enormous mess given all the decisions that are taken for them during the early years of their life.\nIt is not easy to imagine what to do in such a particular case as every child is born with male and female characteristics but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen every time in the same way. Oftentimes, they have physical health problems that need to be addressed if not urgently, eventually in most cases.\nI wonder why is this scenario not discussed more often when we are talking about gender, as it is a great challenge that allows accomplishing deeper insight into the consequences of applying gender roles to others.\nHave you ever imagined what would you do if you had an intersex child?\nI will tell you that \u0026ldquo;supporting my child\u0026rdquo;, though is laudable, is not an answer that will solve the challenge.\nHave you ever put yourself in the skin of an intersex teenager?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if you were a confident teenager, but most are not. Try to make life-changing decisions when your brain is still developing.\nSome people include intersex in the Trans label and hope that would be enough for them. As if gender dysphoria had anything to do with literally being born with a combination of male and female biological traits. This is completely wrong because, in order to transition, you have to go from one point to the other and in the case of intersex people, they are born in the middle.\nBiology is not so clear anymore, is it?\nEthics, morality or feelings become incredibly personal and related to the individual at issue. Even the thought of giving a suggestion to someone in such a position makes me tremble. The only thing it comes up to my mind is meditation, getting in touch with the self and letting it talk. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the inner self has better ideas than the whole of society, which clearly has no clue.\nRespect and compassion That is what a debate is about: respect and compassion. We get into discussions too eager to expose arguments and convince those who disagree with us. But in this debate, I feel like we haven\u0026rsquo;t got enough arguments to have such strong opinions as I often read about.\nWe ought to listen more to those who we disagree with because they might raise a topic that can lead us to something new for us to research, even if what they are saying is utterly wrong. Yes, it hurts, but they might have a point.\nAs long as respect is on the table we should be compassionate with whoever joins the debate with curiosity. I understand that it feels irritating to hear someone talking when they still know very little. Like the Dunning-Kruger effect shows, it is inevitable that the dumbest always try to speak loudly, but unfortunately, we all go through the lowest point of the curve before we rise up.\nWe are all wrong at some point in our lives and we all wish for someone to have enough patience so we have room to express ourselves as we learn. When we are constantly told to shut up because we\u0026rsquo;ve made a mistake we stop being interested in the subject. Gender is a very important subject, whether we end up creating new ones or erasing them all together.\nThe other Schrödinger’s scenario: while it\u0026rsquo;s in the closed box, which gender is the cat?\n","date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_8441.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/gender_debate/","title":"The gender debate: do you know where you stand? Then, I have questions for you"},{"content":"Picture\u0026rsquo;s Source: Lithograph of the “Department of Electricity”\nThere are plenty of reasons to feel anxious, there is no denying that, but we must admit we are living in a very exciting moment in history. We have turned fantasy into reality thanks to technology and we have reached incredibly deep areas of knowledge.\nStill, I can agree, modern life is not a walk in the park. The job market is quite unstable due to the failure of the current economic system, and the free implementation of robotics will make it harder. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound challenging enough, the cost of living is rapidly increasing as food, water and energy prices (aka basic necessities) raise much faster than salaries.\nEven though we are enjoying the best time as human beings, we are facing endless amounts of uncertainty, a good deal of it being created by our instinct of acquiring information. We read about the piling up of climate change issues while very little seems to be done. We feel alone in the search for a solution because there is an epidemic of loneliness creating a lack of community. And, worst of all, we see ourselves with our hands tied as we betray our values and principles living in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t match our subjective philosophy.\nWho is searching for an alternative future? Perhaps, you are someone who rejects the humanistic interpretation that has monopolised our discussions. You might be one of those who see themselves just like any other animal, a simple being who has the unique opportunity to experience life before they die. You might even be vegetarian.\nAn octopus is born and soon wanders alone through the ocean, focusing its efforts on staying safe and nourished while investigating, learning and enjoying its world. In the same way, humans are meant to use their creativity to design a home where to feel safe and nourished while we just enjoy life. But we live in a work-centred society and that is not how it functions. Still, you are nearly burned out and you may wonder, instead of living to work, why don\u0026rsquo;t we work to live?\nOr maybe your disenchantment with the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall in a good work-life balance, but it goes more around a spiritual perspective. You want to feel the universe and its energy. You may be done with manipulative behaviours and threatening environments that don\u0026rsquo;t allow you to develop your inner self as they jeopardise your mental health. You must know, wanting to learn about oneself is no weakness, it is rather a bold attitude, a courageous one.\nThere are many available options for you I am not talking about movements like minimalism as I considered most of them a capitalistic distraction from the real issue. I am not going to ask you to spend the money you don\u0026rsquo;t have to get the best biological/fair-trade/organic/any-of-those-untrustworthy-labels groceries. We can not change the system from our homes. When a product arrives in our local shops most likely all the decisions have already been taken with very little chance for us to do anything about it.\nInstead, I am proposing a real alternative with no additives: ecovillages.\nOf course, it is not a simple one! Did you think I could solve all our problems in only one article? Of course, not, but it is a feasible idea. It is an attainable future with much to offer.\nEcovillages Don\u0026rsquo;t get frightened by the idea. It\u0026rsquo;s not another hippie movement in which we are supposed to live in huts and talk about chakras all day long.\nEcovillages are a manifestation of conscious human innovation and creativity: groups of people living out their principles, regenerating their environment, and increasing their sense of belonging and purpose as a community.\n— https://gen-europe.org/\nThe purpose of an ecovillage is to enable people to live closer to nature while sharing a community that provides support during difficult times. Anything beyond that has to be discussed, and that\u0026rsquo;s why we have many different examples of what an ecovillage looks like.\nEuropean Ecovillage Map Here you can check an example of a European organization that provided support to communities interested in creating their own ecovillage\nWhen I first encounter this term I was expecting an idealistic picture of countryside living. I grew up in a rural area so I knew that summers can be beautiful while winters can be awful. Also, I know some people might want to get their hands dirty but not everybody is willing to plant tomatoes and collect berries. Some people just want to keep on going with their careers but in a more peaceful way.\nAnd that is why it has to be an ecovillage and not a house in the countryside. When you live in a community, big or small, you don\u0026rsquo;t need everybody baking bread. And in the same way, you might need someone who can fix things or someone who can use technology for the advance of an eco-friendly society.\nOne concern that many people may have is social relationships. Fortunately, the anarchist movement has given us much knowledge about non-hierarchical organizations like a sociocracy can be.\nSociocracy is a theory of governance that seeks to create psychologically safe environments and productive organizations. It draws on the use of consent, rather than majority voting, in discussion and decision-making by people who have a shared goal or work process.\nThis kind of system works very well in more undersized groups with independent power to make decisions. Its philosophy goes against centralism because it is the understanding that different cultures and geographic areas have diverse needs.\nAnother question appears when it comes to entertainment. What do you do when there are not that many people around? Some of these settlements have barely a dozen people which results in the most peaceful place on earth, but indeed it can become tedious over time. Luckily enough, some others can go well over the hundred. Let me remind you of two facts:\nA human being can only maintain a good social relationship with a total of 150 people You can have many acquaintances but only a few real friends (fewer people to hang out with can mean deeper relationships) However, ecovillages don\u0026rsquo;t always have to be a remote kind of living. They can be a few kilometres away from the city giving its residents the opportunity to enjoy its services every now and then. There are even some small cities that are implementing changes towards developing an ecotown in which the priority is to keep diaphanous green spaces available to the public where citizens are no more strangers\u0026rsquo; faces, but actual members of the same community.\nSometimes you can find a particular version of an ecovillage in a residential building where they\u0026rsquo;ve modified the structure to collect rainwater and use solar energy becoming not only sustainable but nearly off the grid. In this kind of building, terraces and balconies are used to grow vegetables and allocated common recreational areas provide both adults and children with a space where to socialise and develop useful skills without hiding behind apartment doors.\nA better future is on the way I imagine that, after watching the news at dinner time or checking your social media while you sit in the toilet, you must have a feeling of doom blocking any motivation that might lie inside you. But I hope that you realise that just because something is not shown in front of your eyes every time, minute and day, doesn’t imply that it does not exist.\nThe old futuristic vision of automated cities in which we would be living surrounded by plastic, metal and cement may not be your cup of tea, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there are no options. Plenty of people are unifying efforts towards the kind of future we want and deserve. As an example, we have the Global Ecovillage Network that supports the USA or Latin America and GEN Europe on the other end of the Atlantic. In Spain and Portugal, you can have a look at the Red Ibérica de Ecoaldeas, which since 2001 is an official association that gives support to new eco-friendly communities in addition to the informative events and practical courses they regularly organize.\nThe system might want you to give up and keep consuming. They might want you to deal with the climate crisis their own way. But there are other possibilities and there are people making it a reality.\nNo project is perfect. No path lacks stones. And our house is burning.\nNow, are we going to sit waiting for whatever future a bunch of rich baby-minded people dictates we should have? Or are we going to make \u0026ldquo;weird\u0026rdquo; decisions outside of the mainstream culture that have the potential to recover our planet and create a fulfilling life experience for us?\nThis cow wants you to look after yourself and the planet. Please, listen very carefully to her.\n","date":"2023-01-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/640px-Electrical_building,_World%27s_Columbian_Exposition,_Chicago,_1892.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/a_future_with_no_anxiety_ecovillages/","title":"A future that puts your anxiety at ease and it does exist"},{"content":"Photo by Caitlin Wynne on Unsplash\nA real possibility that never materialized In the last few years, bad news have covered all the edges of the mass media. We have faced plenty of challenges that required our attention, all of them being extensively reported. But life is not only about surviving, it\u0026rsquo;s about cherishing the good moments, and in this case, good news.\nYes, we have avoided a great catastrophe. We are not living in a nuclear winter! Nowadays, it might sound small but it is not. In the 80s it was a genuine threat to humanity. The cold war was not so cold, and there were those who saw nuclear weapons as an essential necessity. Even within the scientific community, there was a disparity in opinions as it was not only a matter of numbers and equations but also a matter of politics.\nAt the time, a river of cautionary articles preaching about the different possibilities of our future filled magazines, newspapers and TV shows. Not so different to the present situation after all. Some thought that the U.S.S.R was very close to starting a nuclear war, and some considered that the USA had to be more than prepared to answer with the same ammunition. And vice-versa.\nOthers considered this the perfect combination for a disaster of catastrophic dimensions. The scientists who follow this line of thought went on with investigations and simulations that seemed to confirm their fears. Carl Sagan himself didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to warm the public in any media that became available to him. Given the evidence he had and the international situation taking place, he issued a direct call to action risking in the process being called a doomsayer. (He is still considered so by those who don\u0026rsquo;t believe in climate change.)\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll never know if their warnings worked, or if the hippie movement pressured the political atmosphere enough to change the Government\u0026rsquo;s approach to the matter. It could be the fall of the Soviet Union or the already displayed destructive potential of nuclear power (ex. Hiroshima or Chornobyl) that became the so-needed tangible proof to start taking it seriously. But we\u0026rsquo;ve avoided a catastrophe!\nThe huge cloud of dusk that would settle in our atmosphere and would teleport us to a weird chapter of Game of Thrones hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened. Not only that but there are fewer changes for this to occur as the known number of nuclear weapons available in the world has decreased. This is great news, especially because it is a good example of how humans can be reasonable when our survival depends on it.\nHere is an extract of the Farewell Adress to the Nation that Jimmy Carter read on January 14, 1981:\n“Nuclear weapons are an expression of one side of our human character. But there’s another side. The same rocket technology that delivers nuclear warheads has also taken us peacefully into space. From that perspective, we see our Earth as it really is — a small and fragile and beautiful blue globe, the only home we have. We see no barriers of race or religion or country. We see the essential unity of our species and our planet. And with faith and common sense, that bright vision will ultimately prevail.”\nWithout the efforts of numerous people bringing to light all their concerns, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here. It is undeniable that we need to know the dangers that threaten our future in order to fight them.\nHowever, that is not all.\nIt is very important to remind ourselves that there is hope because otherwise, why would we fight? We might live through challenging times in which we have to raise our concerns and make sure we are heard. But during those hard times, we must remember we will get through as we already have.\nToday is Blue Monday, the saddest day of the year for many people. When I am writing this piece I am thinking of them. I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to add even one drop of sorrow to their sadness.\nAt this point, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even matter if you are a concerned ecologist or a raging negationist. Media feeds on our survival instinct, we look for the danger and cannot stop the urge to be informed about it. Bad news sell as gold and good ones barely get any attention from readers, so whatever you want to write you are going to be very prompt to do it gloomily.\nAnother biological characteristic of us is that we tend to forget the danger we feared but never ensued. We stick with the terrifying stories because those are the ones we need to tell our children so they don\u0026rsquo;t get eaten by a tiger. An impulsive behaviour we have going on against our inspiration for the happy news.\nThose of us writing content have to start taking responsibility for what we put out there. We have a young generation with outrageous levels of depression and anxiety that needs our help. It is very difficult to dream about a future when everything is telling you there won’t be one. There are many more of us laying out what is wrong with our current world than people proposing solutions or telling the positive side of it.\nGen Z needs an image in their minds which shows something they can eventually achieve. Just one picture can be enough as it was for Dr Viktor Frankl (the psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz) during his incarceration. He hoped to one day see his wife again and he trusted his gut until the end of his struggle no matter how bad the situation looked. As Frankl mentions in his book Man\u0026rsquo;s Search For Meaning, there is a fact that we cannot ignore:\n“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”\n― Friedrich Nietzsche\nA climate collapse is no trifle, neither was it a nuclear winter. We have survived the madness of nepotism and the erratic behaviour of the powerful. We cannot ignore the problem, sure, but we can cling to hope; and that will keep us happier and alive.\n","date":"2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/caitlin-wynne-4D953R0aRUo-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/avoiding_a_catastrophe_nuclear_winter/","title":"How humanity avoided a catastrophe and still does"},{"content":"Do you think you would recognize a squatter if you see one? Squatters may look different from us. Nowadays, they are almost a separate species because of the way they live. They\u0026rsquo;ve developed in different ways and we can observe such adaptations in their behaviour. They deal with uncertainty much better than us. That is evolution playing its hand. They don\u0026rsquo;t bother with any expensive insurance that secures their future simply because they cannot afford it. Instead, they live day by day, enjoying little things like food and water. But they have not yet developed far enough so they still have to deal with the primary need for shelter.\n“We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them.”\n— Christian Nestell Bovee\nI recently discovered that people outside of Spain know plenty about the squatters problem we have. The subject came up in a few discussions with international friends, and certainly, my conversation partners were undoubtedly up-to-date about the matter thanks to the news.\nI grew concerned when they told me about the horrific experiences big real state businesses have. My friends were considering buying a house and ended up rejecting the idea because of squatters! The fact that they cannot move to Spain because finding a job there that pays for a mortgage is nearly impossible had nothing to do with their last-minute decision to back down.\nSquatters are an unpleasant inconvenience for those who own so much property that they leave it abandoned for years. I can imagine how horrible it must feel when you go to refurbish that old apartment that you left empty for five years while waiting for the prices to come up; and suddenly you find out that a homeless family, for lack of decent social housing, has been creating their home there. What despair!\nMost people don\u0026rsquo;t want to be rich. They just want to accumulate more than enough to survive a few centuries in case something goes wrong and our strong social net unexpectedly gets a hole.\nThe whole issue with squatters only adds up to this unsettling feeling. We depart from a fearful and anxious deck to be guided by a compass that shows us how scary the world can be if we don\u0026rsquo;t take precautions to the very last detail. And when it comes to housing all alarms go off. Who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do anything to avoid losing the right to an entire business of dignified roofs over a lazy squatter specimen?\n“Thinking will not overcome fear but action will.” — W. Clement Stone\nMost people are aware of this fact. When you are afraid the best thing to calm your preoccupations is to do something about it. If you don\u0026rsquo;t take precautions you might end up regretting not having taken them. If there is something juicier in life than a sense of safety that is looking smart.\nAnd so the house security and insurance companies know. They knock on your door right after the morning news or while you are scrolling down your phone (your personal electronic prophet of doom). Nevertheless, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen quite a few of their ads on TV. In magazines too. On your social media feed, possibly. I would bet the radio, too. “Are you going on vacation? You might not have a house when you get back!”\nIn the beginning, you might think they are overreacting but after a few months with the same message getting into your grey matter you eventually accept that if such ads exist, there must be a good reason for it. As far as you know, there are definitely no scams on TV. And when they finally cross your door for a quick informative chat in which they exaggerate and fabricate even more frightening stories customised for your particular taste, your fragile inner grandma starts to take them seriously.\n“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”\n— Franklin D. Roosevelt\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the media gives so much attention to squatters, because they worry about the people and their deepest feelings. They\u0026rsquo;ve never had a private agenda in which their goal is to sell as much spot advertising and teleshopping as possible. Of course, not!\nBut you know, they are fallible, so they invent stories in which old ladies went out shopping and came back to a squatted house missing the detail that in that case, we are not even talking about squattering but about forced entry and that is handled right away by the police without any questions asked. They innocently forget that in order to consider a house occupation as squatted it has to be previously unoccupied and no one must live there (including second residences).\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t say either that the big majority of the squatted houses are owned by banks and real state investment fund businesses because if they do, they risk having to mention that those banks were rescued with public money during the 2008 crisis without any positive repercussions to the already struggling population. They kept the money and then took those apartments that cost heavily to the common house seekers and sold them for cheap money to real state investment funds like Blackstone or Blackrock. They could not mention the names of their dear friends next to such a scandal.\nIt is much better for the news business to create demand for your advertising clients than informing about any kind of real crisis going on. Especially if those crises have a close relationship with the bad management of political parties that fund your precious business. You don\u0026rsquo;t want hundreds of exploited journalists losing their jobs because you happened to be an honest chief editor? Do you?\n\u0026ldquo;Life is what passes by while you worry about the squatters that might enter a flat you don\u0026rsquo;t own during the holidays you cannot afford.\u0026rdquo; — graffiti in the streets of Madrid\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the situation in Spain, people are incredibly busy fretting about an insignificant chance of getting their house squatted while their healthcare system is becoming remodelled, innocent rappers are still in uncomfortable institutional hotels for singing a badly written song and the Spanish Royal Family keeps adding games and crimes to their personal diaries with the blessing of the justice system. And then they say the Spanish are lazy! We are frenetic worriers!\nYou might see this as an endemic issue of a passional country. An issue that affects one of the so-called “PIGS” (aka Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) because badly-managed economies tend to see consequences down the line like citizens turning into a totally new species that lives excellently well in uncertainty. But I warn you just like an insurance company does. This is a systemic issue that we all eventually have to face.\n“People do not occupy for the sake of it, people want to pay rent, they want to pay for their electricity, their water, they want to live quietly. Occupying is living in a state of permanent alarm, not knowing when they are going to come to evict you, not knowing when a group of paramilitaries will come to your house to threaten you. It really is not a comfortable situation as some people want to show, it is quite the opposite.”\n— Lucía Delgado (spokesperson for the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages)\nIf we read deeper into the \u0026ldquo;squatters problem\u0026rdquo; we get to some minor social issues, much less interesting to the common people than a few usurped houses. As a reporter, you must always choose the most relevant topics for your readers (as is the case of the squatters) but if you have some empty corner in your paper you can actually fill it up with quite some sensationalist headlines:\nResidential exclusion or how you get rejected as a tenant because of your heritage, nationality or sexual condition! Unavailable dwellings or how big capitals are hoarding all housing so we all become renters! Abusive rent prizes and the odyssey to find a decent house that doesn\u0026rsquo;t burn three-quarters of a single person\u0026rsquo;s salary! Evictions: the last trend on cruelty directed to both adults and powerless children! Gentrification and how we kick destitute people out of their poor neighbourhoods so we can have a Pumpkin Late a few miles away! But you and I know that all these topics are for people who like to complain all day long and haven\u0026rsquo;t yet met the art of positive thinking. The future awaits us and we should not waste our time with empty discussions about how 8 billion people are going to survive on an angry piece of rock that is shaking its parasites out. The answer to that is easy. We simply need some order and we can create our perfect sustainable society.\nWe have plenty of science-fiction manuals that explain in detail how to snatch willpower from people and create a society where we hear no complaints, only the screams of the suicidal as they fall. But how do we get there starting from the society we already have? How do we achieve this future?\n“The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.”\n― George Orwell\nFirst, we avoid aiming any efforts toward improving the social housing stock which gives us the opportunity to increase prizes at will. At this point, we have to remain strong because some people will demand regulation. We do not want such a thing since this would constrain our ability to financially abuse both tenants and buyers.\nIf we manage to control the situation we will have the perfect setting to extend the length of the average mortgage up to at least 30 years and that way we can charge insane ever-increasing interests. During this period of inflation, we must not raise salaries as this would allow citizens to keep up with their payments and therefore they would not fail to settle their debts.\nAfter a few years of struggle, we get quite an advanced position to negotiate. People will be way over the edge, unable to pay their mortgages and with hunger knocking at their doors. Levels of poverty might raise filling the streets with the stinking sights of human misery, but it\u0026rsquo;s also time for the good news: Let the eviction games begin!\nNow, here we have two sides of the same coin. On one hand, great capitalists can buy real estate very cheaply. Actually, banks get to keep thousands of houses and the already-paid interest for money they loaned but never really had! On the other hand, not so bright, you get people protesting on the streets, public shelters are crowded, and worst of all, squatters enter empty unused buildings and pretend to refurbish them to later use them as their primary and only residence. Outrageous, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nBe patient! Bear in mind, this is the toughest time for a greedy investor to build a boring and joyless society. It is hard to confront the fact that after sitting for hours in fancy restaurants listening to empty conversations over a 200€ bottle of wine while bribing the correct politician, we still have to witness how a homeless Amazon worker dares to challenge the system and find a home for his or her family throwing all our efforts out of the window.\nFortunately, this only happens in less than 0,5% of the total housing stock, and we are constantly backed up by the authorities with all the exaggerated violence that might be required. In general, people accept their fate and their tantrums don\u0026rsquo;t bother us that much. So even though it\u0026rsquo;s a painful headache, is worth our time.\nWith these easy steps, each day we get closer to a utopia that suits only a few. The trick is to make sure we are one of them. Perhaps you haven\u0026rsquo;t been born into a rich family but you can always build a tech company in your parent\u0026rsquo;s garage, if they have one, and have unusual and revolutionary ideas that will catapult you to the top. Once you are there, just follow these steps and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to fill out your \u0026ldquo;Greediness Journal\u0026rdquo; every morning for a more successful outcome.\nOn a last note… If you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with my wise advice you can always politize yourself and start taking sides on issues that don\u0026rsquo;t affect you at present time but that can potentially shape your future\u0026rsquo;s landscape. You can waste your money supporting independent media that provides you with more useful and objective news. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend this option because it requires much reading and it spoils many unethical pleasures that you haven\u0026rsquo;t questioned before.\nIt can turn your world upside down and you might find out that your best friend is a jerk. You can also realise you were not right all the time and become depressed by the enormous amount of knowledge you will never acquire. You will be drawn to take life slower and confront reality in ways you\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced.\nIf you decide to take this path you must know there is an endless list of dreadful consequences and solely a beneficial one: wisdom.\n“Our passion for learning … is our tool for survival.”\n— Carl Sagan.\n","date":"2023-01-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_1060.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/squatters_spain/","title":"The irony of Squatters in Spain"},{"content":"Photo source: neom.com One more mortgage on our planet I\u0026rsquo;ve been researching The Line, the incredible project that Prince Mohammed Bin Salman presented a couple of years ago as he showed his vision of the future of Saudi Arabia. When I decided to write this piece, I had an idea in mind:\nThe wealthy must be building their little oasis for when climate change finally leaves us all with an unlivable planet.\nNow, after quite a bit of reading, I think they just don\u0026rsquo;t know what the f**k they are doing. I guess they don’t know that you can’t breathe dollars.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know about it, here is the official advertisement. As you can see, they have spent a lot of effort on it. It is worth watching, even if you think of it as a science-fiction short film. But bare in mind this is just a simulation. None of it is real.\nVideo source: neom.com This Neom project is part of Saudi Arabia\u0026rsquo;s 2030 vision. In the last few years, the country has developed in many ways. They have given women some of our beloved rights allowing us to drive and paying us equal salaries for equal work. They also have invested in education and technology. It\u0026rsquo;s as if Prince Mohammed wanted to say: Saudi Arabia is open for international business. Which I hope happens and affects the population in a positive way.\nThis huge city, planned to accommodate 9 million people, is supposed to be that future. However, according to many engineers, architects and strategists, it\u0026rsquo;s not realistic.\nDo we have the required technology to run it? Neom promises a transportation system that can travel 170km in twenty minutes. Japan is still building the fastest train we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even qualify for Neom\u0026rsquo;s requirements. In fact, Japan has trouble getting it to term, and they don\u0026rsquo;t expect to have it ready until 2027.\nAnother issue comes when you look at the water supply. The available desalination options are not very efficient, and the alternative designs are in the early stages of development and won\u0026rsquo;t be a reality by 2030.\nThe current situation means that Neom would have to release millions of tons of CO2/year into the atmosphere and a bunch of litters of brine water into the sea, messing up the oxygen levels and, therefore, the marine life. So much for their zero-carbon marketing.\nAnd then the structure itself. Five hundred meters tall walls and separated by a 200 meters gap?\nAm I the only one who feels claustrophobic only thinking about it?\nHow is the air going to flow if the outer environment is overheated by mirror glass walls? We don\u0026rsquo;t want another pandemic in those circumstances. I guess they expect to spend even more energy on air-con than we already do.\nThey also promised fresh air and plenty of vegetation as if it were an easy task in those conditions, but there is no real plan to get natural sunlight inside the walls.\nOk! You are right! Technology evolves fast.\nMaybe they solve all those issues in a revolutionary way that brings abundance to the nation. But that is exactly what it\u0026rsquo;s being done in many other projects that entail much less risk than The Line.\nDoes it really preserve the surroundings? They claim that \u0026ldquo;95% of land will be preserved for nature\u0026rdquo;. It is true that due to its narrow design, the soil surface used for building might correspond to only 5% of the land. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that its construction won\u0026rsquo;t have any repercussions on the natural surroundings.\nSource: Center for Large Landscape Conservation For instance, the linear concept creates a fragmentation of natural habits. Along the highway, you probably have seen some wildlife corridors placed to allow animal migration. This is an indispensable feature for an environmentally friendly layout, one that The Line lacks from start to finish.\nNeom might be located in a dry ecosystem, but in a desert, there are still thousands of species that will be affected by this giant obstacle. The issue is not only about animals being unable to travel; it\u0026rsquo;s about biodiversity, about inbreeding and genetic mutations that can lead to the deterioration of the species.\nAnd all of that without mentioning the walls that will for sure be a massive trap to birds. Already glassy skyscrapers have shown their devastating influence on them; I cannot imagine 170 km of a continuous mirror barrier.\nPhoto: Rhea in Talampaya National Park (by Lucía Ferro) On top of it, we have to think if building a city from scratch can actually be more sustainable than improving what we already have. Right in Saudi Arabia, we have many examples of disproportionately construction works that didn\u0026rsquo;t lead to anything positive. Much territory was stolen from the sea with the intention of building man-made islands that would function as holiday resorts.\nI cannot begin to tell you how terribly it has impacted marine life. If it had at least a reasonable purpose, we could weigh the consequences, but the reality is that very little of the new ground was eventually used at all. It only served one goal shared only by a reduced proportion of the country\u0026rsquo;s population: to create more capital for those who already have it.\nPhoto by Aldo Loya on Unsplash Who is going to live there? Since a city is a place where large amounts of people live, this is the most relevant question of all.\nFor a start, the government is pushing people out of their land. Entire tribes have to relocate, God knows where. There has yet to be a plan for their relocation.\nAre they going to get a nice spot in the future Neom?\nAnd in that case, is it fair to force someone to live in a totally different way than they\u0026rsquo;ve always had?\nIn their marketing campaign, they insist that old cities are designed around industries and that The line is tailored to prioritize humans over anything else. Correct me if I am wrong, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like they have put much thought into their fellow countryman.\nIn a sense, it has an explanation: the project is expected to cost over 1$ trillion! The government can\u0026rsquo;t afford it, so they are left with only one option. They need investors, rich people who want a part in it, maybe an apartment in a promising exotic town in which they can relax for a couple of weeks, oblivious to the reality of the world. A world in which most people can\u0026rsquo;t afford a house and struggle to pay rent. I don\u0026rsquo;t know nor understand their plan.\nWhat I do know is that they certainly haven\u0026rsquo;t found anyone to inhabit Dubai\u0026rsquo;s man-made islands.\nWhat is Price Mohammed bin Salman\u0026rsquo;s political agenda? After questioning and refuting their architectural and environmental arguments, I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to find a good reason to initiate the project as it is, other than attention.\nSome have mentioned the Prince\u0026rsquo;s aspirations of building the modern pyramid of Giza, something to leave behind that will keep his name in the history books. I think that even though it is a plausible idea, there has to be something else underneath.\nI do agree with the fact that this endeavour is attracting quite some attention and that it is an efficient way of marketing the country. In the end, we are mentioning the nation\u0026rsquo;s name more often than we would otherwise. But it seems rather excessive to give the go-ahead to such an expensive project without any special purpose in mind.\nWhat kind of economic activities will there be? One of the most frequent complaints about its feasibility is that in order to get people to go and live there, there has to be some sort of economic activity going on.\nGiven that we are talking about a modular city in the middle of the desert, we are facing a lack of interest and motivation for the initial residents. The reason why technological cities grow none stop is that companies want to be where other companies are. In other words, they seek an already existent business fabric that enables them to improve production.\nI understand this is what they are hoping for, but they are not giving any details about how they plan to achieve it.\nIn order to make it more appealing, it looks like they want to create Neom as a “city-state”, that is to say, a city with its own laws and tax system. They are talking about a free trade zone. In that case, people wouldn’t live in the city; they would come for a few days for business and then go. That is why there put a lot of emphasis on the recent airport build in the area.\nFollowing this possibility, the city will be totally independent of Saudi Arabia’s government, though it would still be part of the country, and it would have certain financial advantages for those internationals that want to do business. All of it without having to adapt to the Arabic culture while quite likely being served by lower-class Saudis.\nIt sounds very much like a tax haven, and I doubt very much that the average population of the country will gain much from it. Why do they have to leave their culture behind if we are talking about their future?\nWhere are the locals who disagree? Around the time of Neom\u0026rsquo;s introduction to the world, Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who dared to criticize the development of this city, disappeared and, later, he was found dead.\nDifferent countries investigated the matter getting to the conclusion that the murder must have been ordered by the Prince. As often happens in these cases, it is difficult to find justice further than those who directly committed the crime. Nevertheless, it points out how much this project meant for Saudi Arabia\u0026rsquo;s royalty and how little is still the freedom of speech for those who disagree with their power.\nWhy does he trust the untrustworthy? Up until this point, even if most aspects of the project were quite fishy, I was ready to give them the benefit of the doubt. But then I came across their experts. On their official website, they show who is in charge of management and development.\nPerhaps I am too naive, but I was expecting them to put this project into their own people\u0026rsquo;s hands. They talked so much about their country\u0026rsquo;s future that I thought the logical thing to do was to rely on them, Saudis who know the land and understand the needs of their own population.\nHowever, what I found were ex-pats from America or even Australia. And, to my surprise, a Spanish Chief Urban Planning Officer. I am Spanish myself, so when I saw his name (Antoni Vives) I was very intrigued.\nThe site provided a small background about them in which it was mentioned he was the Former Deputy of Barcelona. Then, my scepticism pushed me to research his profile to satisfy my curiosity and also to understand a bit more about the spirit of this design.\nHis name is very well known in the Catalonian Region, but not for good reasons. Only last year, he was sentenced to two years in prison for corruption, later reduced to six months of community service. During his time in Barcelona\u0026rsquo;s city council, Antoni Vives defrauded the sum of 155.067 euros. He has also been linked to at least another case of corruption that is currently under investigation in the courts.\nDo you think this is the right man for the job?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what the Prince\u0026rsquo;s intentions with the Neom project are, but I do know he is taking some high risks here. If he plays well his cards he might make some pocket money for himself but, what’s a prince without his kingdom?\nDuring an interview with Aljazeera, Journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in relationship to the 1$ trillion costs of the project, said:\n\u0026ldquo;What if it goes wrong? It could bankrupt the country! And no one is allowed to criticise it.\u0026rdquo;\nPrice Mohammed Bin Salman has trusted the future of his nation to very unreliable businessmen who won\u0026rsquo;t blink an eye if they see the opportunity to fill their pockets with dirty money and fly away to the next county.\nThe Prince might not lose his money, but he might lose his country. And who is going to lose the most are the Saudis.\n","date":"2023-01-02T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/neom.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/theline/","title":"Is the rich 1 % spending tons of money on saving (only) themselves, or are they just plain idiots?"},{"content":"Photo: That lost soul is the author A poem about searching\nSometimes in the morning, I just want to run\nfar from these daunting feelings of dark clouds.\nI would like to visit everybody\u0026rsquo;s mind\nbecause I am seeking the knowledge of the Freeman.\nBut then, a familiar odour pushes me to recall\nthat there is no such info.

He slept on the sideroad. We have just passed Black Friday and any other excuse for excessive consumption before Christmas crazy spending. Usually, I am all against this kind of event. I am the kind of person everybody hates because I keep reminding others that capitalism makes us miserable and unhappy. That we should focus on people and reduce our attachment to things.\nBut this year, I just forgot all about it. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t planning to make any particular purchases, and the whole \u0026ldquo;special offers thing\u0026rdquo; just slipped my mind.\nI use AdBlock in my browser to avoid advertisements as much as possible. Some webs don\u0026rsquo;t allow it, but for the most part, it works pretty well. Mainly, I am not the victim of aggressive marketing. I still have to swallow a few ads, of course. I did hear of the coming Black Friday; I just didn\u0026rsquo;t know on which days it fell this year.\nTo give a bit of context, a few months ago, I noticed my phone was freezing increasingly often. This is a long story that I am going to make short by saying that I ended up buying a new phone case. For me, the moment I bought it was just any day, but it was not.\nI made the order only a few days before I left for a long trip. I was driving from the Netherlands to Spain, and of course, I wanted to have my new phone case. I was a bit disappointed to see that the expected arrival day was the same day I was leaving. Actually, it could be that day or two days later. Anyway, right before I got into my car, I checked the mail, and there it was.\nYes, I bought the damned phone case on Black Friday week. A phone case might seem like a small detail, but it felt huge when later I witness the struggles of those in charge of delivering my little acquisition with my own eyes.\nWe buy plenty of things all year round. We do it as often as our pockets allow it and as much as our desires demand it. More often than not, those things are our emotions bottled up into impulses and transformed into objects that are supposed to bring us happiness. And if we dare to question it, we have plenty of excuses to confront any remorse.\n\u0026ldquo;I deserve it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only a few bucks!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was cheaper, and I needed it anyway.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen we left home for our trip, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t thinking about that. I was more worried about the affairs of long travels. We were driving nearby Paris when we had to decide where to spend the night. We have a small van, and we resolved to save some money and sleep in it, even though winter is the worst time for such an adventure.\nWhile looking for a nice spot, I started to pay attention to other people on the road. There was no other van. A few cars pass by, probably stopping for a coffee in order to stay alert during their last driving hour. And then, a thousand trucks. It was full of trucks.\nWe had made this trip before, so I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised by it, should I?\nBut there was something different. I am not talking about parking lots full of trucks. I am talking about truck drivers sleeping beside the highway, right on the roadside, nearly touching the hard shoulder. And it was not an eccentric and patientless driver. No. It was one truck after the other. Quite a few kilometres of professional drivers unable to find a parking lot where to spend the night. Now, parked without a bathroom or a warm cup of tea. All of it so I could have a new phone case for my trip to Spain.\nI, the proud woman full of principles, was a participant in their exploitation.\nI wish I had gotten something clear out of all of this, but the truth is: I ignore how to do better. I am trying to figure out how to fight against these injustices without adding to them, but no answers have come to me. Only one question:\nAre we left so powerless that we can\u0026rsquo;t avoid hurting the weakest?\n","date":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/zetong-li-mVqTumQH-c0-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/consupmtion_consequences_truck_drivers/","title":"The consequences of consumption go beyond what you imagine"},{"content":"Photo by Sandy Millar on Unsplash\nLook around, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see. When we think of a family, we often picture the same structure: mother, father, little boy and tiny girl. It\u0026rsquo;s sad, but for most of us, that\u0026rsquo;s how our brain is wired, and I am not talking in a biological sense; I am talking in an ideological sense.\nI am going to start by saying that capitalism has offered many things to humanity; there is no questioning that. We also sense, or know, that its time has come to an end. And as usually happens in the final chapters, we are here to reflect on the past and learn from it.\nFamily is a construct that bends according to culture. Capitalist lifestyle is a culture so well spread that we don\u0026rsquo;t even notice how far its impact goes. We get our traditions confused with it because the economic system adapts to any beliefs turning them into products, and we are happy they look good on us. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we have done with our families; we \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo; them to look good.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not why capitalism broke \u0026ldquo;the family\u0026rdquo;. It goes beyond that. It is not only a matter of looks, not even a matter of status. It is a matter of control. Before the last feminist revolution, we were infused with the idea that women should stay home taking care of the house and delivering babies to fuel the working force. We stopped questioning it, mainly because the materialistic standard of living was improving for everyone. Yes, maybe thanks to destroying the planet and creating huge future debt, but it seemed to improve consistently.\nUntil now, people didn\u0026rsquo;t really have to ask themselves what their future would be like. Work was always available, and labour was fairly paid. The salary of one man could support a family with three or four children easily. We were told that every generation would live better and better, and we believed it.\nToday it sounds almost crazy, but before, we had a world where companies needed an increment of the labour force so badly that they paid enough to feed a decent family. Did you ever wonder why?\nBack then, the world population had much smaller numbers. The industries were growing, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the advantages of our present technology, so men\u0026rsquo;s power was really important to have. They could have exploited their workers like they do now and like they did before with plain slavery, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t look good, especially when you are criticizing communism and other government systems. Also, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help in the situation they were in. In addition, the demand was high, so the profits came easily as long as they had people working. The wheel was spinning fast and furious. Companies didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about many regulations because, at that time, very few people cared about the climate, which also added to their financial gain. You can say they could afford to pay good salaries, and not only that, they needed employees to be overproductive because they didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough workers to fulfil their future projections. To motivate their workforce to perform more and better and even more to the point of exhaustion, the powerful class introduced the culture of effort.\n\u0026ldquo;If you go the extra mile, you\u0026rsquo;ll get the extra dime.\u0026rdquo;\nLiterally, companies through money to their problem, the shortage of manpower.\nDuring this period it\u0026rsquo;s when today\u0026rsquo;s manufactured idea of a family came into play. The fast-growing industry was craving more heads, more hands, more legs; more bodies to build the modern version of the Egyptian pyramids. Women were then encouraged to stay at home, both to show their husbands were able to support their families and to take care of their springs. Even though contraceptive methods were already available, they were not widely used. Having many children was a blessing. More hands to work! About this time it is when the housewife term was \u0026ldquo;invented\u0026rdquo;. These wives were at home all the time, and any activity they did, according to society, should be related to their homes. But it is not like these women weren\u0026rsquo;t doing any work for the industry (and society). They were actually doing the most important one. Women were literally creating the substitution of the always exhausted workforce. They were educating them about the capitalist system, just like the upper class needed them to do. And the best thing of all, they were doing this job at no cost to the owners of the industry. The reproductive labour, the caring labour, and the education labour were totally free. So much it was that we stopped to consider it a job altogether. As if looking after someone supposes no effort, as if the physical work put into creating a life and breastfeeding had no meaning in this world.\nFor a while, it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. People were happy enough in economic terms because the men were getting enough money to cover all the expenses and therefore, women were \u0026ldquo;indirectly\u0026rdquo; paid. Of course, this meant that many women started to suffer financial abuse, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the main subject of this article. The perfect family had a hardworking husband, a loving wife, and at least one smart boy and a pretty girl. The couple would become independent from their parents as soon as they got married because, back then, you could easily afford a house. Capitalism had created the perfect family.\nThis perfect family was never perfect. Maybe from a materialistic point of view, it was. But when we approach it from an emotional and mental perspective, we find many issues. Domestic violence was highly common, LGBT people were pushed out of society as they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to create their own perfect family, working women were seen as odd and unworthy, a single mum couldn\u0026rsquo;t access well-paid jobs… But leaving this crucial matter aside, those who fell into the \u0026ldquo;perfect family\u0026rdquo; structure had quite a gracious life. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have it nowadays?\nToday, not even the whole salary of two people is enough to support a family. We are asked to give 200% at our jobs as if the future of the company had anything to do with our personal future. We complain and demand dignity for everybody, but as a result, we are told that we are lazy because we don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend our lives working to destroy a planet that already sees us as a plague. When women were going out of their homes to work, we were told that it would make them free. They were joining the workforce to be at the same level as men. What actually happened is that the average salary started to decrease as the total number of the workforce increased. Women remained in charge of reproductive labour, but they also had to handle a regular job, often worse paid than men. No compensation for agreeing to put your body through pregnancy and delivery, nor for taking care of the dependent members of the family. Did you know that pregnancy can shorten a woman\u0026rsquo;s lifespan? A soldier goes to war, and since it is a risky situation, they get extra paid for that. A miner who works extracting toxic materials gets health compensation. But women creating the future workforce are punished because they need time to recover from labour and to comply with breastfeeding. Note that delivering a baby is called labour, though it is not financially compensated by society.\nBoth men and women, members of the working class, are feeling powerless towards the notion of creating a family simply because the idea seems like a titanic project. If you want to have, not only the time to be with your child, but the energy, too, you are left with no options. Women need to fulfil their intellectual passions, so the answer doesn\u0026rsquo;t come from sacrificing our freedom. I don\u0026rsquo;t often see men willing to stay at home to care for their children, but even those that would like to do it don\u0026rsquo;t have the opportunity as we still require at least two salaries to raise a child. Elon Musk can criticize the common people for not having children. I understand his point of view as a businessman. However, deliberately having them without the means and time to give them is reckless and egoistic. Here, of course, I am not counting those people who unexpectedly see themselves facing pregnancy and have to make a subjective decision. That is a moral question that each of us should answer independently.\nAs a consequence of this difficult milieu, people are isolating themselves as their lives only spin around work in order to survive, which leaves them with no energy to invest in a relationship. Many women are so afraid of being financially abused like their mothers or simply losing their freedom that they fear men altogether. Men have always been isolated within themselves, unable to share any discomforting feelings, and now, with the level of competition that we find in the labour market, even friendship seems controversial. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how many times I heard, even used, the famous quote that says: \u0026ldquo;We are born alone, we live alone, and we die alone.\u0026rdquo; We usually say it as justification for disappointment after our heart has been broken by a lover or a friend. We forget that Orson Welles\u0026rsquo;s quote didn\u0026rsquo;t end there.\n\u0026ldquo;Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we’re not alone.\u0026rdquo;\nBelonging might be an illusion, but since our minds are no reality, loneliness is an illusion too.\nPhoto by Vladyslav Tobolenko on Unsplash\nA family is often the easiest way of getting that belonging feeling, an accessible reason for happiness. Though with the current challenges youth is facing, a family it\u0026rsquo;s now a responsibility that we are not ready to take. We aren\u0026rsquo;t ready, not because we are not brave. We are not ready because we have no stability at all. Nor economically, socially, mentally, or environmentally. Even in old rich countries like European ones, we are relying upon the cruel and vice decisions of a few delusional men. If you want to get depressed in no time, listen to a political scientist or an expert in geopolitics.\nIt seems that the later generations have only one hope for happiness. People need to start thinking about other family options, other forms of social organization and community. This means that we are going to have to challenge the system as this \u0026ldquo;manufactured family\u0026rdquo; is the base of the current system. The are many questions to answer, like who are we going to manage the inheritance of capital. Though I believe we have greater problems than the obstacles that a new type of family can bring.\nIf we are fair, the future has no relevance in our current life because we lack any interventional power over it. Of course, we can concern ourselves with it in a political way, but in our daily lives, it makes no sense to think much about it. We are left with the present, which is actually quite a nice gift. But we have to learn to unwrap it and enjoy it. Human beings need relationships based on emotional connection, not only acquaintances that you wave at in the street. Not those colleagues with who you talk politely but only about the weather. Real human connections that only a family can provide. The good news is that, as I said before, family is a construct, a concept that is uniquely subjected to yourself. A family doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to involve a husband or a wife or even children. Frequently, it is integrated by friends. A family can be only one person who makes you feel comfortable with yourself. A family only entails love and respect.\nDo you dare to disappoint capitalism?\nDo you dare to design your own \u0026ldquo;perfect family\u0026rdquo;?\nDo you dare to confront social uniformity?\nAnd if so, what is your master plan?\n","date":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/sandy-millar-KhStXRVhfog-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/capitalism_broke_family/","title":"Capitalism broke the family trying to create the perfect one"},{"content":"When the wolf gives advice to the sheep At the beginning of this month, The Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations (CEOE) advised the media not to talk about in terms of rich and poor because it could create social instability. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree more. Given the current socioeconomic situation, if you allow people to think about where they stand, you risk getting them upset. I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to get anybody upset. So I am going to stay neutral and start talking about the middle class.\nAnd I wonder. Who is the middle class?\nWhen you search for a concept, you often find many definitions, but in most cases, these definitions differ in only small details.\nHowever, in the case of the middle class, we can see how its definition has changed a great deal over time. If we think of it as the middle point between the upper and the lower classes, we end up with many questions. The upper class are those who don\u0026rsquo;t need to work as they own a fair amount of capital and they hold property of production means which are run by employees. In contraposition, the lower class needs to sell their labour power in order to get the minimum capital required to survive. That\u0026rsquo;s why it is called the working class. So, as Marx and Engels defined, and so anybody that knows how to draw the middle point on a line, it is wise to assume that the middle class are those who own the bare minimum property of production means, but they are still required to work as to keep it generating capital. I would like to put some emphasis on owning the production means because this particularity makes a huge difference.\nSearching to gather an impression of what nowadays is understood as the middle class, I opened an article from Investopedia (the standard website for many people interested in finance) in which Adam Hayes offers a completely different definition. I could do nothing but become incensed. Here is a portion of their explanation:\nMiddle-class families tend to own their own home (although with a mortgage), own a car (although with a loan or lease), send their kids to college (although with student loans or scholarships), are saving for retirement, and have enough disposable savings to afford certain luxuries like dining out and vacations.\nMiddle class families tend to own their own home (although with a mortgage)\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but paying for a mortgage is not the same as owning a house. It might be better than paying rent, but it definitely means that you do not own a house yet. And as far as I know, having an adequate roof over our heads is nothing more than a sign of a decent and dignified life.\nown a car (although with a loan or lease)\nA car is often a requirement to work. If they want to make money, many people are bound to use one. Both in Europe and in America, the average price for used vehicles is slightly above 20,000 euros/dollars. Does it make sense that a middle-class citizen needs a loan to pay for that?\nsend their kids to college (although with student loans or scholarships)\nEducation is not an extra; it is not some hobby. An educated society is less violent. Educated citizens are the ones who fight against pandemics or create amazing technology. A university loan is a mortgage for the student. A scholarship is a reward for the student\u0026rsquo;s excellence. None of them is a direct perk of the middle class.\nare saving for retirement\nWho doesn\u0026rsquo;t have in their mind to save for retirement? I will tell you who. Those who need to pay a mortgage, a car lease and a student loan.\nand have enough disposable savings to afford certain luxuries like dining out and vacations.\nApparently, getting pizza every Friday and going to the beach for a week in summer are luxuries. Who needs a break? Certainly not human beings.\nIn his definition of the middle class, Hayes doesn\u0026rsquo;t even mention the means of production, which are the most important pillar when it comes to talking about social structure. If you don\u0026rsquo;t own your house, you don\u0026rsquo;t own your workshop, you don\u0026rsquo;t own your car, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have money (capital) to invest in your children\u0026rsquo;s education, are you really anywhere near the middle?\nGlobal shareholders of wealth by wealth group, Credit Suisse, 2021\nFrom this graphic, we take that 11% of the population has more than $100k in property, and therefore they are middle class. But I wonder, where do you find a house that costs about $100K? Which factory or shop can you afford? Who can actually own anything if you don\u0026rsquo;t have at least up to $250K? The minimum required to belong in the middle class, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be, at least, the amount needed to purchase a house? How far would that 11% shrink? 5%? 6%?\nI thought that the middle class was supposed to be a group of people that don\u0026rsquo;t live surrounded by gold but do have real financial security. This is a situation in which you can take a health break and not panic because you and your family will struggle. Otherwise, what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between a middle-class and a working-class citizen?\nThe difference is becoming more subtle every day.\nIf you are a middle-class citizen, you might think that most of your interests lie right next to the upper class. You might think that if you were to pay fewer taxes, you would be able to save more money and eventually go up the ladder a few steps. Many people think that way. Many people vote for politicians who claim lowering taxes will solve our issues. And it would be an appealing idea if it only it was true.\nIn the last decades, the USA has predominately followed a philosophy of tax resistance. It is not surprising that there is not much of a safety net for regular citizens. In the European continent, taxes are much higher, and so are the social benefits applied to vulnerable citizens. In any case, the discussion about taxation is a popular subject.\nIn the UK, they have recently been juggling with it. First, reducing the tax requirement for the super-rich overseas people on the bases of attracting more wealthy people to the country. As anticipated by the sceptical, the UK government lost £3.2bn in annual tax revenue. Then, when it struggled to meet its obligations, the government retreated to its previous tax rules. Only the super-rich (1%) benefited: big companies with already enough capital and power. The middle class and other ordinary taxpayers saw how their welfare state deteriorated while the energy bill and groceries became dangerously unaffordable. After witnessing this embarrassing performance, UK\u0026rsquo;s economy has lost reliability and power.\nOn the other side of the coin is Spain; the Budget Minister recently announced new tax rules for 2023. In this case, the tax cuts will favour small businesses, the self-employed, and workers earning less than €21,000 ($20,490) a year. It directly affects 1.344.000 ordinary taxpayers, people who are struggling with the burdens of inflation and the energy crisis. These measures will lift some of that weight off their shoulders. The government will have the capacity to afford it thanks to the implementation of a “solidarity tax” on people with assets worth at least €3 million. The new tax disturbs only 23,000 citizens (0.1% of the population) and has the potential to collect €1.5 billion.\nBussinesEurope (the European employers’ association) seems to be so concerned with the new taxation that they had to send a letter to some members of the European Government. But why?\n“The class war never ends, the masters never relent.” — Noah Chomsky\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it is because they worry about the middle class, much less about the working class. A good deal of the people from BussinessEurope and the CEOE belong to the 1% shown in the bar chart previously displayed, and they are not to be trusted when it comes to standard citizens\u0026rsquo; interests. As I said earlier, if you identify as a middle-class citizen, you might think your interests are aligned with theirs, but I hope you can now see that lowering taxes is not always to your benefit.\nWe often hear the freedom argument. \u0026ldquo;Taxes are restrictions and, therefore, reduce my liberty.\u0026rdquo; If you truly want to be free, you need a state to protect you. An organization that watches for justice and provides for your weakest moments. Without a funded state, we are not living in freedom we are living in the jungle, where the strongest (the rich) will do whatever they want.\nThe current situation of climate change is a clear example. The average taxpayer can\u0026rsquo;t do much about it. Only a big organization can make the big changes we need. But, if that big organization is private and has private interests, it is not going to find the motivation to care about the environment. They are going to keep polluting because it is indeed profitable. They are going to keep destroying the Earth because they have already built their little oasis where only a few will be safe. For that, we need the state, a well-funded state that can protect the common interest of the public.\nWhen the base of a pyramid is robust, you have more chances to keep your status. The middle class is disappearing by the minute, and the working class is turning into plain poor. Think about it. If you were to slip and fall or even be pushed down, rising from the solid ground is much easier than emerging from shifting sands. Tax contributions are the stones that build our future. At the moment, our future is owned by a few, and none of them is middle class.\n\u0026ldquo;We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.\u0026rdquo; ― Ursula K. Le Guin\nThe Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations (CEOE) doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to talk about the rich and the poor because it wants people to believe they can become part of the middle class and have a comfortable future. Actually, the middle class is on the brink of extinction, and the lower class is confronting harsher living conditions. Those with economic power want us to dream we can become them because while we do so, we don\u0026rsquo;t bother them. But we are far away from them, and we will be even further if we don\u0026rsquo;t force them to pay higher taxes.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make them pay taxes for all the damage they\u0026rsquo;ve done in the name of profit. Furthermore, they have plenty of money to get out and go to space. So, as Trump says: \u0026ldquo;If they don\u0026rsquo;t like it here, they can leave.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2222.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/middleclass/","title":"Are you middle class?

I am well aware of the sorrow that emerges from a belief crashing inside you. Cognitive dissonance is one of the most unpleasant experiences for the human mind. For the human body, even. Hopefully, this article won\u0026rsquo;t create any pain for anyone, though I have the feeling it will certainly itch.\n\u0026ldquo;Emperor Constantine, in the year 303, assembled a small redaction team and commissioned them to write the four Gospel and several other texts, all of them falsified, in order to implant his new religion throughout the Roman Empire, Christianity.\u0026rdquo;\nIt might sound nuts, but there is proof this is what happened. Fernando Conde Torrens spent 20 years researching the existence of Jesus before he, in 2016, finally put all the clues together in his last book Año 303. Inventan el Cristianismo (Year 303. Invention of Christianity).\nConde Torrens was 40 years old when he suffered a crisis of faith in the Church and felt the need to dig deeper. He is no atheist; he is a believer with great curiosity and greater respect for God. Conde Torrens started this journey only by trying to learn more so he could put in place all the irony and double standards he witnessed in Christianity. To do so, he learned Greek and Hebrew, which allowed him to directly read the ancient texts without intermediaries that could potentially edulcorate the content. After all this effort, he eventually got to the bottom of it: Jesus is a fictional character, and Christianity is an invented religion.\nHis book provides irrefutable documentary evidence present in the texts themselves (the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, John and various other writings of the New Testament), which show that all of them are the work of the same person, one of the members of the writing team assembled by Constantine.\u0026quot;\nPicture of the Testimonium Flavianum in Wikipedia Now, if you are a well-read Christian, you are probably thinking about Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian who supposedly wrote about Jesus\u0026rsquo; crucifixion following his description of Pontius Pilate. Here is the passage that Josephus supposedly wrote.\nAbout this time there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought to call him a man. For he was one who performed surprising deeds and was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Christ. And when, upon the accusation of the principal men among us, Pilate had condemned him to a cross, those who had first come to love him did not cease. He appeared to them spending a third day restored to life, for the prophets of God had foretold these things and a thousand other marvels about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared. (18.3., transl. by Louis H. Feldman)\nHowever, both historians and theologians reason that this passage has been subsequently added with the intention of validating Christian beliefs. First of all, because if Jesus had existed, his contemporary followers would have written about him and his teachings, as happened with Socrates, and not 60 years later based on what Flavio had heard around. Another argument is that Josephus was not only Jew but very involved with his faith. Therefore, he would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah. Also, the explicit inclusion of Christian phraseology, which was slowly developed through the years, highly suggests the presence of some interpolations (alterations). In other words, someone felt the need to alter the text.\nSome people still hold onto the hope that even if the writing was altered, Josephus originally meant to mention Jesus anyway, and so they call it a partially original Testimonium. But they don\u0026rsquo;t really have any proof to believe in such a thing. In fact, it looks like this paragraph is cutting halfway through a passage, separating it into two fragments that otherwise would have a perfect union with each other. The Testimonium Flavianum is merely a paragraph that was written totally out of context, while a historical text was copied.\nAccording to Fernando Conde\u0026rsquo;s studies, Flavius Josephus wrote his Judaic Antiquities without citing Jesus Christ at all. About two hundred years later, Constantine formed a team made up of Lactantius and Eusebius of Cesarea, who was a historian. As their intention was to generate proof to support their new \u0026ldquo;religion of the Empire\u0026rdquo;, Eusebio changed Flavius Josephus\u0026rsquo;s text to put a piece in which he quoted Jesus Christ.\nIt appears that Lactantius and Eusebius were Constantine\u0026rsquo;s acquaintances, but they were very different to each other. Eusebius was a very reflexive man, very interested in philosophy-like thinking. On the other hand, Lactantius, who lived through a rough time in the Roman Empire, was convinced that the world was getting to an end. It appears he showed this ideology in his book The Divine Institutes, and it is by studying his work that Conde Torrens realized he had an essential role in developing the Christian imaginary. Lactantius was obsessed with miracles, the creation of the Church and hell as a punishment. He appeared to be a very repressed man, and so he also was very fond of criticizing \u0026ldquo;sinful\u0026rdquo; lifestyles.\nEusebius wanted to create some doctrine to help people live their lives. Lactantius wished to avoid the end of the world. And Constantine, well, he wanted to create a religion that would bring his Empire together. He didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to do this; it was Theodosius about 50 years later. But I think we can say he did give it a good start.\nDuring his studies, Conde Torrens discovered that the authors of the New Testament had left much evidence behind. For instance, Eusebius, who was not happy with Lactantius\u0026rsquo;s line of work, left several acrostics throughout the texts (acronyms used in compositions written in verse). The use of acrostics was a widespread practice then, so it is no surprise he did so. Interestingly, these acrostics are meant to make fun of the text as they mean something like \u0026ldquo;I laugh out loud\u0026rdquo;. It seems to be a way of stating his disagreements with Lactantius.\nAlthough unintentionally, Lactantius also left footprints. At that time, scribes regularly used a personal pattern in their texts to mark authenticity. Lactantius was a proud man and a professor of rhetoric, so he used a highly complex one that would demonstrate his skills. It showed his ability, sure, but it also left tracks that could be traced back to his previous works. Thanks to this unique pattern, Fernando Conde could also see that some of Lactantius\u0026rsquo; texts had been modified later on, possibly by Eusebius, who lived longer than him.\nThe Gospels were not enough to validate a religion, so they kept on writing, repeating the same things over and over and adding some agnostic and heretic testimonies that would provide more realism to the story. They did a pretty good job indeed; because seventeen centuries later, the world spins around the belief that a prophet named Jesus ever walked the Earth. Christians, Muslims and other religions all together managed to keep this fictional character alive, just like Skywalker or Don Quijote.\nWith this article, I am not questioning anyone\u0026rsquo;s faith in God. God can be a spiritual being, Nature itself or just a feeling of uncertainty. You are the one to decide that. But Jesus is just a tale, and the whole establishment created around it that goes by the name of the Christian Church is the invention of a few men in their search for power.\nIt saddens me to think of all that knowledge, now lost, that the expansion of Christianity (and other monotheistic religions that followed) has banished from humanity\u0026rsquo;s old collective and diverse culture. In the same way that some of the Christian teachings can be wise, many other religions and beliefs would have provided a philosophical aid to manage our current world. We should be crying out for the American tribes that perished, for the African ones we ignore, for the flexibility of polytheism and for the ancient heathen knowledge that is long gone. What saddens me the most is the detachment from nature that the monotheistic way of looking at morality and ethics has imposed on us. But that is another article that I should write.\n","date":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_7492.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/is_jesus_fictional/","title":"Is Jesus a fictional character?"},{"content":"A poem that, in my head, it\u0026rsquo;s jazz It’s Monday,\nand you’re already done.\nIt’s Monday,\nand you’ve had enough.\nFour days\nseem too much,\nbut you don\u0026rsquo;t know\nwhat would they hide.\nA shiny cold day\nor a pleasant lunch.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Monday,\nwhat a bad start.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve judged the week\nbefore you\u0026rsquo;ve tried\nto look for moments\nthat make worthy lifes.\nThey turn dark clouds\ninto bright smiles\nas though lifejackets\nof happy times.\nMarvellous tiny stars\nin a gloomy quiet sky.\nEnjoy them all,\none by one.\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s Monday,\nand you\u0026rsquo;ve found your laugh.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Monday,\nand you\u0026rsquo;ve dared to dance.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Monday,\none of a thousand-plus.\n","date":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2885.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/its_monday/","title":"It’s Monday"},{"content":"Photo by freestocks on Unsplash\nAbout earth and spirit Today is the 31st of October, you\u0026rsquo;ve heard of it as Halloween, and you possibly consider it the Night of the Witches. You may think of it as spells, pumpkins and candy, but its origins have little to do with it.\nOrigin Photo by K. Mitch Hodge on Unsplash Everything started in Europe, precisely in the Celtic nations. The tradition originates in the druid festivity of Samhain, which actually didn\u0026rsquo;t have a specific date but was celebrated around the 5th-7th of November. Celts were a culture with great devotion to Nature, so the origin of Halloween has much to do with the end of the harvest. When all the land work was finished, it was time to enjoy all the goods, but also, it was time for reflection. Very much like New Year\u0026rsquo;s Eve for us today.\nSpirituality Photo by Lucía Ferro The Samhain ended with the Gathering of the Spirits. The belief is that, during that night, the ancient burial mounds were open, seen as portals to the Otherworld. The most fearless living dared to enter the realms of the spirits, wandering in them (just like in the movie \u0026ldquo;Coco\u0026rdquo;) and getting some insights about life itself.\nThere was plenty of spirituality; however, none had anything to do with God or the Christian religion until much later. All of them were pagan traditions with a tight relationship with Nature. Pope Gregory III saw the success of the Roman Pagan Festival of Lemuria and wanted to give this date a Christian meaning. Romans celebrated a feast during which they performed rites to exorcise the malevolent and fearful ghosts of the dead from their homes. The Pope perceived this as profane and potentially threatening and decided to move the All Saint\u0026rsquo;s Day (All Hallows\u0026rsquo;Day) that used to be honoured on the 13th of May to the 1st of November, overlapping and eclipsing the pagan festivity.\nSymbology Photo by Emma-Jane Hobden on Unsplash Today we use a pumpkin as a Halloween symbol, but a pumpkin was not always the preferred vegetable to empty. In some parts of Europe, they used turnips. Yes, turnips! In the same way we do now, a turnip was opened, and a candle was placed inside. The pumpkin tradition is originally from Ireland, and since they look so cool, it expanded worldwide.\nFood! Photo by Gaby Dyson on Unsplash Nowadays, nobody can imagine Halloween without candy, but that was not a thing a couple of centuries ago. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there weren\u0026rsquo;t any sweets. At the end of the harvest, nuts such as almonds and chestnuts were widely available, so things like marron glacé and marzipan Saint\u0026rsquo;s Bones were a common option. This time of the year is also blessed with plenty of apples and grapes, which means the drinks of choice were new wine and sweet cider.\nReturning to Nature Photo by Pema Lama on Unsplash They say there is no time like the present, and we live quite a weird one. We have forgotten what it is to be a living being that needs the generosity of the land to survive. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why many people are starting to return to this old tradition that allows us to connect with nature and our spirituality.\nPeople want to understand what it means to be human. People start to wonder what vegetables are grown each season, not out of innocent curiosity but because they know that the only way out of this climate apocalypse is by treating Nature more respectfully. People are hopelessly losing any sense of time as seasons are starting to banish due to the extreme changes in the weather. Hurricanes, droughts and growing deserts are just signs of Nature\u0026rsquo;s wrath.\nAnd like in any other belief, if you fear your God, in this case, Nature, the wise thing to do is pray. Celebrate a bountiful harvest (eat fresh), ask the spirits to show you the right way (reflect), and thank them for what you still have (take care of the land for next year\u0026rsquo;s planting).\nAnd Happy Samhain!\n","date":"2022-10-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/freestocks-kVv8AvoKJ7g-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/the_original_samhain_why_the_celebration_-halloween/","title":"The original Samhain and why the celebration of Halloween is more meaningful than ever"},{"content":"A new perspective on an old concept The world feels big.\nBig like the desert when you just leave the oasis.\nChaos burns full of entropy\nlike the skin of my feet\nstepping on boiling sand bathed with dry heat.\nI cannot bare any more\nthe details of this reality.\nI want to be drowsy and bored\nwith some soothing fantasy.\nBut this strong and wild and feverish curiosity\ndraws me to facts like a scientist.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t even know if I have the capacity\nto comprehend its complexity\nbut I try hard to seek the truth\nand exchange it for my beliefs\nhoping that the sacrifice will help society.\nDoes it make sense now, all this anxiety?\n","date":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/worlA.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/world_anxiety/","title":"World Anxiety"},{"content":"Delirium, the final frontier Have you ever been so confused that you are simultaneously certain of your senses and losing your mind?\nMaybe you had Covid-19 and thought you were about to cross to the other side.\nMaybe one night, you were running a fever, and that veil between imagination and reality slowly faded away until you fell into a spiral of very uncomfortable feelings.\nOr maybe you had been working so much and sleeping so little that you would gladly let yourself go into a light slumber right while you are performing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry. No need to be shy. I have been there, too. Floating in the unknown of the human mind.\nDelirium is a state of mental confusion that comes on very suddenly and lasts hours to days.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like a very alien issue, does it? According to the American Delirium Society, more than 7 million hospitalized Americans suffer from delirium each year. I often wonder how many people go through it in the privacy of their homes and don\u0026rsquo;t tell a soul. It must be so easy to go unnoticed in a dysfunctional family. Look, auntie Mildred is talking nonsense again… Let\u0026rsquo;s ignore her for a few days.\nDelirium is a psychiatric syndrome known as an acute confusional state, a decline in our mental function over a short period of time. It\u0026rsquo;s as though the difference between delirium and psychosis is the amount of patience available to the witness. If the witness of such a mental state is willing to make an effort, the victim has a chance of avoiding a hideous label. If whoever is watching the affected contributes to the instability, for instance with gaslighting, then the victim has a lot more lottery tickets to go down the rabbit hole. But, since we lack much evidence to fully describe any of those experiences, I will leave that statement as a personal wild assumption that I needed to get off my chest.\nAnyway… What we know for sure is the financial impact of delirium. According to a 2008 study done on the healthcare cost associated with delirium, the national burden of delirium on the healthcare system goes as high as $152 billion each year. If you ask Dr Aaron Pinkhasov from NYU Winthrop Hospital, he will tell you that it can get up to $164 billion a year. And now that Covid has sent a good chunk of the population through intensive care, I reckon that amount has grown even higher.\nBut $$$ isn\u0026rsquo;t the greatest consequence of all. Delirium has been proven to have long-term effects on the human mind, as E Wesley Ely often explains in his public lectures.\nPatients with delirium have longer hospital stays and lower 6-month survival than do patients without delirium, and preliminary research suggests that delirium may be associated with cognitive impairment that persists months to years after discharge.\nThis negative outcome often has the looks of depression or PTSD between other manifestations, and it is known as post-ICU syndrome. It seems that the intensive care experience is highly traumatizing, which in a way, explains why the mind enters such a state as delirium.\nUnfortunately, the list of risk factors is as long as a Egyptian scroll.\nThis is a link to the Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship (CIBS) Center. It is an organization focused on gathering and digesting knowledge in order to improve models of care for people affected by critical illness, especially delirium.\nThe following table shows the most common risk factors for delirium. Some of them are intrinsic to the patient, as is a visual or hearing impairment. Some others are factors related to the illness they are confronting, for example, a respiratory disease. But here is an interesting group: Iatrogenic factors. Those are aspects of the treatment that produce damage even though they were meant to help in the first place. In that box are immobilization, medication and sleep disturbances.\nSorry about the tiny picture, here is a link to a better display If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever been in an ICU, you will know that it is a very bright and noisy environment where heavy drugs are dealt faster than in Ibiza. We may see it as a low price to pay when it comes to helping people, and it is a fair approach to it, given that without them, many people would lose their lives. But what life are we talking about?\nSome patients diagnosed with post-ICU syndrome have to leave their jobs and even forego a pleasant hobby due to the severe life-changing consequences of delirium. This is not one unlucky case, these are millions of people. Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we at least try to go deeper into those risk factors that we can control?\nThere is no determined way to manage delirium. In most cases, professionals fall back into antipsychotic medication and physical restrain. This is how it is been done, and they don\u0026rsquo;t have time or energy to go looking around for alternatives that would make their job even more difficult.\nHowever, evidence shows that benzodiazepines and antipsychotics do not reduce the duration of delirium, they might control agitation and hallucinations, but they don\u0026rsquo;t improve the outcome of the patient. In this paper about Haloperidol and Ziprasidone for Treatment of Delirium in Critical Illness researchers found that the widely known haloperidol doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to significantly alter the duration of delirium compared to a placebo.\nThen what? Are we right where it all started 30 or 40 years ago?\nNot really. Wes Ely leading the medical community, has developed a patient-focused care method called the ABCDEF bundle in which mobilization, reduction of medication use and close delirium monitoring have an important role.\nAs a medical community, we now have published data on over 25,000 patients in ICUs all over North America that there is a dose-response relationship between higher compliance with the ABCEDF bundle and higher survival, shorter time on mechanical ventilation, earlier discharge from the ICU and hospital, fewer bounce backs to the ICU, less delirium and coma, less use of restraints, lower cost of care, and lower rates of discharge to nursing homes and rehabilitation facilities.\nBecause post-ICU syndrome affects not only the patient but the family, too, efforts have recently been put towards interviewing and learning about their experience and perspective. The results of this Australian study prompt the medical community to pay attention to the environment as it appears to be the main \u0026ldquo;controllable\u0026rdquo; cause of sleep deprivation, a great contributor to the development of delirium.\nParticipants described the intensive care as a noisy, bright, confronting and scary environment that prevented sleep and was suboptimal for recovery. Bedspaces were described as small and cluttered, with limited access to natural light or cognitive stimulation. The limited ability to personalise the environment and maintain connections with family and the outside world was considered especially problematic.\nNot surprisingly, when medical, allied health and nursing clinicians are asked about it, they show a very similar perspective. Professionals seem to be frustrated with the impossibility of providing comfort to patients and families. When I was a student nurse, I spent a few months in a critical area, and I remember going back home and listening to alarms going off in my head as if I was still in the hospital, unable to turn them off. I cannot imagine how torturous it must be for those patients who find no possible rest from the constant bleep bleep bleep that surrounds them. On top of that, you can add the pain and emotional baggage of a critical illness, though these can be palliated, they are not avoidable.\nParticipants noted that the bland, sterile environment, devoid of natural light and views of the outside world, negatively affected both staff and patients’ mood and motivation.\nThe intensive care environment is unconventional, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be so hostile. Think about how many technological companies modify their workspace to accommodate workers with special needs. These changes allow neurodivergent people to not only hold a job (which is already very challenging in the regular world) but to excel at what they are doing. If we take this example to the hospital, it is easy to understand the need to redesign the intensive care bedspace. An ICU room must be built with the needs of the people using them in mind.\nIn April 2019, Philips introduced VitalMinds, a new non-pharmacological approach to help reduce delirium in the ICU based on an improved design of the bedspace. This project monitors noise disturbances and manages the patient\u0026rsquo;s exposure to normal levels of light, which potentially allows better control of natural sleep-wake rhythms for patients.\nSource: Philips VitalSky The preliminary results of a study done by Alawi Luetz show that a modification in the ICU environment is significantly associated with a reduced delirium incidence. But why is this direction of research and development so relevant to mental health in general?\nPsychology and psychiatry are fields with very little consensus between their professionals. Science seems to have trouble getting to understand the human brain and, even more, human behaviour. I think we can all agree that more research is needed.\nEarly this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) informed that the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by 25% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those are not issues that stay in the past. According to UN News, nearly one billion people worldwide suffer from some form of mental disorder, as stated in the last World Mental Health Report published on 16 June 2022. Numbers are telling us that we are, and sadly have been for a while, suffering a mental health pandemia. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that reason enough to act on it?\nShouldn\u0026rsquo;t we take this \u0026ldquo;invisible virus\u0026rdquo; as seriously as we did with the corona?\nWe live in a society that pushes us daily to work hard and to live fast. But humans are no gods. Humans can only do so much. I, that have experimented with the tortures of hallucinations and delusions, urge you all to look at delirium as the end of the rope—that point where our mind finds a wall or an abyss. I don\u0026rsquo;t know which one, but I think we ought to know where the limits of the human mind are, or else, how are we going to confront this new pandemia of mental illness?\n","date":"2022-10-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/ceo.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/the_fine_line_to_madness_is_being_drawn_in_icu/","title":"The fine line to madness is being drawn in ICU"},{"content":"A poem about friendship I was feeling numb when they came.\nNo emotions or a flame.\nThey started to chat,\nand I listen to them.\nThere was no anger\nin what they said.\nNo envy, no revenge.\nI was confused in a sense.\nWhy didn\u0026rsquo;t they complain?\nLife isn\u0026rsquo;t fair,\nand everybody feels some pain.\nLater I came to learn\nthat all those bloody blades,\nonce I had to accept,\nwere not offered by my new friends.\nI was confused in a sense\nbecause they were there\nin case I wanted to share.\nEmulating them,\nI did not whine or protest.\nI simply had a story to tell.\nLucky was I\nfor that, I found people who cared.\nAnd so again,\nI was confused in a sense.\nBut this time, it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter\nbecause, with fresh confusion, I was blessed.\nA big turn in life, a good change.\n","date":"2022-10-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/confusedinasense.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/confused_in_a_sense/","title":"Confused in a sense"},{"content":"She was everywhere but seen nowhere Last night I watched Blonde, the movie about Marilyn Monroe. I will not tell you about the director or the novel is based on. I will tell you about the shadow this film leaves behind.\nThe narrative delivers the story in drops. These are powerful and have intense effects on your consciousness. We are talking about a story that, even though its scenes might not be totally real, is definitely accurate regarding feelings. It is not about what happened to her as much as it is about what such a life does to a human being.\nPhoto by pure julia on Unsplash The photography direction is on point. Every single scene is designed to offer the best possible setting to experience her emotions in your own body. The chosen colours and aspect ratio add to the message as much as the dialogue does. If this movie is about the dissociation between Norma Jean (her real name) and Marilyn, the film photography based on her classic pictures provides half of the information. You, as a viewer are not told or shown; you feel the story. And that is art.\nWhen we think about a happy person, we often put them in a colourful environment with flowers, music and plenty of laughs. We still hold the misconception that someone who can seem to enjoy a particularly happy moment is not ill. We think that if they are showing their teeth, it means they are happy. This happens among the women in such high percentages that we came to consider that a woman who doesn\u0026rsquo;t smile is plain angry. There we have that hideous expression resting bitch face as if a woman taking a breath from cheerfulness meant a threat to those around her.\nGoing back to the topic, Blonde shows precisely that dichotomy in the most epic way possible. There is no glossier smile than that of Marilyn\u0026rsquo;s, but now we suspect what it was hiding underneath. The modern way of living has pushed many of us to isolation, spreading loneliness throughout the globe. I think I am not the only one who sees it. Maybe it is not a new problem, but I would say that, if anything, today mental health is becoming a blurry subject where myths are treated with the same respect as facts, and therefore an open conversation about the matter is more urgent than ever.\nBut why did this film touch me so much? I usually don\u0026rsquo;t care much about celebrities. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get into the debate about Deep and Heard because I don\u0026rsquo;t think we should be playing this public trial game in which we generalize the privileged life of a few famous people as if they could represent the actual issue. During the whole court process, we heard very little about where all this toxic behaviour came from. We witness their passionate fights and discussions without any emotional reflection at all as though we were watching a soap opera. I don\u0026rsquo;t care about drama and to be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t care about Marilyn Monroe either. However, this is something else, this is the story of a child that felt incredibly abandoned, and to me, that\u0026rsquo;s one of the greatest failures of humanity. The pain that she suffered at such a young age not only stuck with her but shaped her personality so deeply that it became an important part of it. Nowadays we talk about mental health, but I often feel people don\u0026rsquo;t really understand how much a sorrowful past can do to a mind. On top of that, there are those creative and sensitive minds that in my opinion are more susceptible to the wonders and horrors of life. I dare to say Norma Jean is one of those minds.\nIt is a fortune to see the beauty clearly and soak yourself in it, but that clarity will also dunk you into the darkness of the world. You cannot choose, you may have them both.\nI feel compelled to recommend this movie because I wish everybody to grow their compassion toward those that are feeling lost and hopeless in life. Deep down, however, I praise this work of art because I long for people to understand my struggle and personal grief more deeply. Or perhaps, I hope to detect others like me in a light conversation about cinema. Either way, I believe that this film made me go momentarily to my very own dark places, but at the same time, it made me feel understood because I was being drawn to the shadows with every other member of the audience.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you are an acquaintance with mental illness or just a film lover, Blonde will make your body tickle.\n","date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/marilynbook.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/blonde_not_a_biopic_but_an_insight_into_mental_health/","title":"Blonde: not a biopic but an insight into mental health"},{"content":"A poem about compassion We think we are brilliant\nwhen we see others’ wrong side.\nWe treat them rough;\nwe ignore their shine.\nAs if life wasn’t hard enough,\nwe forget to note when they’re right.\nAnd that’s what we’ve become:\nJudges of the weak and fragile.\nWe feel strong and tough.\nWe forget our own troubled times\nwithout which we wouldn’t have seen the light.\nIt seems that the one who goes mad\nis the one who can eventually turn wise.\nFor those who stay in safe lands:\nThey seem sane, but they lack insight.\nWe should honour a good crazy laugh\nas it is the inner fire lighting the night.\nIt is beautiful and incredibly sad\nhow much we can’t see with our eyes.\nWhen the moon is dark,\nthere is no interest on our part.\nBut when the moon is helped by the sun,\nwe quickly find its charms.\nWe taste their mutual love filling the sky.\nHelp each other, pals,\nand we will all learn to fly.\nOr at least, we will go forward\naway from where the Lonely die.\nClinging to old dogmas\ndoesn’t allow us to thrive.\nTry to remember that before you criticize.\nI hope\nI shall.\n","date":"2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/paracaidas.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/the_weak_in_the_sky/","title":"The Weak In The Sky"},{"content":"Photo by Isai Ramos on Unsplash\nHave you ever thought that the president of a country, instead of living like the richest 1%, should live like the rest of the population? You are not the only one. And it seems like a utopia, but no. It is possible and not a crazy idea after all. A Prime Minister once refused to live in the presidential residence and donated most of his salary to charity because \u0026ldquo;I earn more than I need\u0026rdquo;. According to him, the wealthy should feel the honour of being able to contribute on a bigger scale than the rest. He is the kind of successful outcast I am talking about.\nThe car that you see above is very similar to the one that Pepe Mujica drives. He is an Uruguayan politician and activist who refused to leave his precious old Beetle behind as he became the president of his country from 2010 to 2015. He also refused to live in the presidential house and remained in his farmhouse, where he still grows food and cares for his animals. This man had as much power as most of us could wish and decided to share it. He did this by giving away $257.210 to build homes for those financially disadvantaged and donating $60.000 in machinery and equipment. But these are just a few examples. His patrimony is the one of a regular citizen, and he still contributes more than many wealthy businessmen do.\nWho is Pepe Mujica? José Alberto Mujica Cordano started his political journey on the losing end of the balance to the point that in the 1960s, he became a guerrillero, and by 1985 he had spent more than 13 years in prison. You would imagine that after spending so much time as a hostage of a dictatorship, he would become bitter and vengeful. Instead, he used his time as a minister and president to look forward and lay out a better future for Uruguay. He has never used politics as an act of personal revenge against those who hurt him so much. When he is asked about it, he answers with the following:\n\u0026ldquo;There are things that you just cannot forget, but in life there are bills that are not collected. They go in a backpack and you just have to learn to walk.\u0026rdquo;\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is a life lesson, but it is certainly good advice. After one has suffered for years, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of extending that suffering only to state the fact that you feel hurt? All the pain you feel every morning isn\u0026rsquo;t going away when you inflict it on others. By lunchtime, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be there. And at night, when you realize you just made someone feel as bad as you feel, that pain will increase. The only way to get some sort of payback is to make something out of that pain. You can create using those feelings, you can talk about it to make people aware of that painful reality, or you can try helping to reduce this way their suffering.\nFeelings are impossible to control, so don\u0026rsquo;t try to control your grief because the past is written in stone. If you need to cry, cry hard until you finish your tears. If you need to hide for a while under a warm blanket, go ahead, but don\u0026rsquo;t stay there forever. Comfort food is also a way of grieving, though you can get fat. But seeking personal justice…. That won\u0026rsquo;t bring you peace. Actually, it will deepen the pain.\nThis is Mujica during an interview in Spanish. Only hearing his voice feels peaceful.\nLesson number 1 \u0026ldquo;Succeeding in life is not winning, it is getting up every time one falls.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s another one of Mujica\u0026rsquo;s wise sentences. As a guerrillero he felt gloriously. He was not only imprisoned but tortured. He was captured. He lost. He failed so badly that anybody would think the game was over. However, after over a decade of cold loneliness, he got up and went back to follow his life\u0026rsquo;s purpose. This story tells me that sometimes it takes time before we can really start getting back on our feet. Holding onto a strain of hope might be all we need. If we forget about winning and focus on enduring, we increase our chances of success. It is a matter of statistics.\nLesson number 2 \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want my son to miss anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He misses you, pendejo!\u0026rdquo;\nMujica often says that he has acquaintances who tell him they work very hard to get as much money as possible so their children will have anything they need. Pepe finds it sad and funny simultaneously because, even though they do it for their children, they can\u0026rsquo;t even spare an afternoon to spend with them. Mujica puts much emphasis on relationships. He reminds us that getting to know someone and creating a friendship takes a lot of effort and time.\nHe also criticizes the accumulation of things, even empty experiences. Filling your house with stuff or filling your time with TV shows won\u0026rsquo;t make much sense as the end approaches. However, meaningful friendships can transcend the \u0026ldquo;here and now\u0026rdquo; of fleeting pleasures. When someone is in love, the happiness they feel is much greater and more lasting than the sexual pleasure of a frugal encounter. And so is everything in life. Just think about that couple of friends that you meet to play board games while wearing sweatpants. They mean much more to you than those you meet on Saturday for a fancy and expensive dinner in the best restaurant in town, just to prove how hard you work in your high-paid job.\nLesson number 3 \u0026ldquo;To be free is to spend the greatest amount of time of our life in what we like to do.\u0026rdquo;\nHow do you want to spend your life\u0026rsquo;s time?\nHow do you want to harness the miracle of having been born?\nMujica asks this question to whoever wants to listen. And, for those who don\u0026rsquo;t want to wonder about it, he tells them: \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, the market will take care of it, and you are going to spend your life buying things you don\u0026rsquo;t really want.\u0026rdquo;\nFreedom is a complicated and relative concept, but I find Mujica\u0026rsquo;s perspective the closest thing to a definition. When we say we want to be free, we usually mean that we want to choose how we live. Some people also want to be able to do anything that comes to their minds. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it is about that. The world is too complicated to grant everybody such choices. If individuals want freedom, it has to be something simple, easy to achieve, and of course, maintainable over time. That\u0026rsquo;s why I like Mujica\u0026rsquo;s idea of freedom, not because it offers many options but because it offers attainable satisfaction. In the supermarket, we see a bunch of different options for each product. They all have different labels, some have different flavours, and some have different sizes or packaging. We also see many price options. You can buy a well-known brand or the supermarket\u0026rsquo;s own brand. And then, of course, you will be offered many discounts and saving-packs. When you leave that supermarket, you might leave with the sensation that you have chosen your groceries with total freedom. Actually, you took those products that the supermarket has decided to offer you, which are often not an inch close to sustainability.\nSome people know the power of the market, and in order to minimize its influence, they only go with a shopping list because freedom is to spend your money on what you want and need. Or how Mujica puts it:\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t buy with money, you buy with the time of your life that you spent on earning that money. And the time of life is not refillable.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen I listen to Pepe Mujica, I always feel like he is saying the most obvious thing in the world. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how many times he speaks; it is still necessary to remind us that we are humans, after all. We are animals who not only survive but seek happiness. We have been shown a path, and we recently found out that the path isn\u0026rsquo;t leading anywhere, so perhaps it is time to look for alternative ways of leaving.\n","date":"2022-09-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/isai-ramos-K0yNjawjRkM-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/three_lifelessons_from_a_successful_outcast/","title":"Three life-lessons from a successful outcast"},{"content":"Photo by Compare Fibre on Unsplash\nMachines creating wonderful things We look at this piece of meat\nlike a bunch of iron hinges, wood and wheels.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t see a body.\nInstead, we see a machine.\nWe misuse it\nletting our blood run free.\nOur sweat.\nOur fluids.\nWe perceive them as waste.\nWe even feel ashamed.\nAs if they were a sign of our character weakening.\nWhy do we so often forget\nthey are proof we are alive and breathing?\nOnly when the body hurts\nwe finally understand\nthat it is a part of us,\nthe reflection of our minds.\nBut then it\u0026rsquo;s full of scars\nimperceptible to the human eye.\nBleeding wounds.

Here you can find previous articles:\nWhy specialization matters in our society: About growth and scarcity Link\nThe environmental and political impact of specialization in our society: The worth of a human being Link\nWe are witnessing social fights that don\u0026rsquo;t seem possible to be solved. These are conflicts in which both sides have very solid opinions with quite delicate arguments. I linked two articles to exemplify: the Dutch farmers\u0026rsquo; issue and the turn in US abortion rights. With both subjects, we enter a field where we get to question life itself. You would imagine that questioning life itself should bring us together. It is common ground, after all. Some of us more, some of us less, but everybody wonders about what it means to be alive. So, why are there so well-defined positions, so far from each other and very little space for dialogue?\nArticle about \u0026lsquo;Emotion and pain\u0026rsquo; as Dutch farmers fight back against huge cuts to livestock by The Guardian Link\nArticle about Why abortion rights are under threat in America by The Economist Link\nIn the first article of this series, I talked about the division of labour. Now I would like to go deeper into it, telling you how Émile Durkheim (French sociologist) thought it impacted the organization of society. To do so, Durkheim focuses on social solidarity and formulates two types that would describe two different societies corresponding to the time before and after the division of labour: mechanical and organic solidarity.\nAccording to the Cambridge Dictionary, solidarity is an agreement between and support for the members of a group.\nWhen solidarity is based on a certain resemblance between its members we call it a mechanical society. In this case, people help each other because they understand the struggle as it is very similar.\nWhen solidarity is based on interdependence between its members, it\u0026rsquo;s an organic society. Here, people need the help of others, and therefore, they help as a repayment.\nBoth types of solidarity are acceptable; none is better than the other as they work in groups with different specifications. A mechanical society works well in small communities, but when it comes to a globalised society, organic solidarity has its benefits. People don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand what others are doing to feel bound to them. But this initial benefit is turning against us. We have a complex interdependent society, and our brains cannot grasp the level of connection needed to keep balance. Yes, humans are social animals. Or should I say they were? We used to be awesome at creating communities. Nowadays, we, the average people, lack the skills even to hold a friendship or to find friends in the first place. Where is all this coming from?\nHumans need connection, and this connection must be of great variety. You could think that in a mechanical society where everybody has a similar life it would be difficult to find such variety, and you would be right. But is it different when you look deep into our organic society managed by algorithms and professional hierarchy? The availability of options for human connection is not an issue; however, finding the motivation to understand them is. We no longer need to deal with that that makes us uncomfortable. We turn around, we go to a different neighbourhood, we block a user, or we stop reading that newspaper. We have so many options that we only care about those that we actually like without leaving any space to learn about the scary unknown. We get so much ideological confirmation that we have no reason to think we might be wrong in any way.\nThe benefits of organic solidarity have been widely discussed, and that\u0026rsquo;s why I am not getting into that. I want to point out some of the less beneficial consequences, consequences that can be mitigated without withdrawing from such a system.\nWhen we look at the world, especially after a troubling pandemia, it is easy to understand that we all depend on each other. We rely on high-skilled jobs as much as low-skilled jobs. Scientists and doctors were indispensable. Cleaners and truck drivers were too. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I ask myself why we still value people\u0026rsquo;s efforts according to the market and not the actual value they have in our society.\nThis interdependence has no balance. We have to admit, in a conversation about politics (the art or science of government, the discussion about organising a society), we tend to give more attention to the CEO of a company than to those indispensable low-skilled workers. Given that the percentage of CEOs in our society is considerably lower than that of cleaners, truck drivers or healthcare assistants, I think we are doing something very wrong. And I am not saying we should implement any solution a random low-skilled worker would suggest. When I write a story, I then give it to an experienced reader to criticise. They usually find problems and also offer solutions. Most of the time, these are not the best solutions, but they found a problem I, as the author, could not see. And this is what politicians should be doing. They must start listening to the people experiencing the consequences of their politics and tackle the issues they say are the biggest concern. A good example is the energy issue we are facing. We see laws getting approved in which the government expects the population to transition to electric cars and homes with renewable energy systems. Well, the population is complaining about the prices. They cannot even afford the regular contaminating energy that we already have. What kind of solidarity is this?\nPhoto by RepentAnd SeekChristJesus on Unsplash When I was young, I thought education would make me wiser. That\u0026rsquo;s what we are told, anyway. It was after much struggle I realised that plain knowledge without any reflection can be worse than plain ignorance with enough awareness. And this is the painful paradox that we have to unravel.\nAn interdependence that takes the fate of many as the hostage of a few is no solidarity. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like interdependence, it sounds like codependency, and as we all know, such a relationship is an opportunity for abuse of power.\nThe shift to organic solidarity is the impact of specialization in society. People became workers, very specialised workers. We all have very different lives, and still, we live in the same society, a very diverse one. But that implies that within it we can find many communities because people will always need a sense of belonging, a feeling that can only be achieved when you are seen. In a globalised world, this is not easy.\nHumanity is dealing with many professions, many passions, many cultures… You can say it is easy to find your small community and be happy there. That is awesome, indeed. However, it is also easy to ignore arguments that don\u0026rsquo;t resonate with you. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect me. It is not important.\u0026rdquo;\nSolidarity is not enough anymore; we need empathy.\nWe are facing the greatest difficulties that humans as a species have ever faced. Luckily, we are not dinosaurs, and we have much knowledge and technology at our disposal. We only have to be wise in how we use it.\nThe particularity of humans is language. Thanks to it we are able to express concepts that cannot be seen. Thanks to it we can listen to experiences we have never lived. My adopted dog might want to tell me about his experience with his previous owner, but he never will. I wish I could understand some of his strange behaviours and eventually help him to have a better life. We both probably would have a better life. So I wonder, if humans have the ability to talk, why don\u0026rsquo;t we listen? Why don\u0026rsquo;t we use this beautiful gift we got to the fullest?\nPhoto by saeed karimi on Unsplash In the last few years, I read a lot about neurodiversity. For those of you who are not familiar with the term Harvard Medical School describes it as the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; way of thinking, learning, and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits. These are people who struggle in life due to a lack of inclusion in the job market and other areas of society. Some neurodivergent manage to adapt, often at the expense of their health, but many get pushed out to a corner. A family doctor who saw many generations pass by said to me that in the past, people with learning disabilities used to have much more access to jobs than nowadays because they could work along with other people and stay as apprentices all their life if necessary. Today, when you go to an interview, one of the first things they want is to see that you can be an independent worker. They want workers who do the job fast and with no help. They don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about them until the time to charge for a product or service comes. It seems that when it suits the market, dependency is not acceptable. But… Wasn\u0026rsquo;t interdependence the critical point that sustains globalisation?\nAs you can see, the idea of a human no longer refers to a talking animal that needs food, water and shelter to survive. The concept of humanity is becoming a very different word: workforce. That\u0026rsquo;s why Elon Musk is so interested in convincing people to have children. He has a big empire to maintain, and only hungry mouths will have the motivation that he wants his workers to have.\nThere are only a few Elon Musk, but there are many humans that shape the so-called workforce. We have to find room to practice empathy. It is the only way to find a common ground that would allow people to stop defending their egos and start understanding what the real issues are. We constantly feel belittled by these lucky guys who tell us that the one who doesn\u0026rsquo;t thrive is because he hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked hard enough. And then we get angry at our neighbours for even thinking about Universal Basic Income when they struggle to feed their children. I don\u0026rsquo;t see any robots paying taxes or daycare. But I do see Musk and Bezos getting rich by the minute thanks to them.\nSolidarity is not enough anymore because that\u0026rsquo;s what the rich do when they drop a few thousand on the poor just to get a good picture in the news.\nWe need empathy because that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing it can actually bring us closer together as a species.\nI am only saying this because I assume we all want to survive. And since I am not building Noah\u0026rsquo;s ark, I have no tickets to sell. Neither do I have money to pay for a seat in the last spaceflight leaving Earth. My only option is on this beautiful planet and its people.\n","date":"2022-09-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/worldhands.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/globalization_sometimes_good_sometimes_shit/","title":"Globalization: sometimes good, sometimes shit"},{"content":"The worth of a human being This is the second piece of a series of articles that explore the effects of a specialized economic system in our society from a worldwide outlook.\nWhy specialization matters in our society: About growth and scarcity Link\nDue to market competition, our current socioeconomic system based on specialization encourages workers to get very good at one task or a few tasks rather than be mediocre at many tasks. Workers and products must be \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; to be considered worthy for the market. Maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, but this means that in the system we are living, worth is measured in money.\n💰\t💵\t🤑\t💰\t💵\t🤑\t💰\t💵\t🤑\t💰\t💵\t🤑\t💰\t💵\nThat is so because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have money, you have neither access to food (basic necessities) nor the means to fund production. In your personal life, you can have a different way of assigning worth to a person, but out there, it\u0026rsquo;s only about money. That is the main issue. The management of society goes around many other objectives, not just wealth. These objectives are even more critical to humanity than wealth. Let\u0026rsquo;s take health as an example. Any investment in a healthy community will be a significant contribution to growth as it ensures able members and reduces the number of dependent people to be taken care of. Nowadays, we put a price on people according to their health. In this socioeconomic system, sick people are not worthy. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if is you, your mother or your little siblings.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s evident that specialization has brought some benefits to our society, but it has come the time to assess what we have been blindly doing all this time and what the consequences are. I will be giving examples; please, understand that I am talking about the average citizen and not my or your particular case.\nResource management Specializing in only one service or product doesn\u0026rsquo;t always mean simplifying. It often means we get more complex management to what used to be a more straightforward procedure. This complexity of the organization comes with many setbacks that enable systematic errors. Eventually, they grow as a snowball and sometimes have a crashing result.\nMaterials Specialization requires a constant flow of materials. We are starting to acknowledge that Earth has a limited amount of resources. Some can be recycled, but most cannot. Once the mine doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any more ore to extract, all those jobs disappear along with the families that depend on it and all the businesses that were based on this material, not to mention the incredible damage it creates in our ecosystems. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s so important to be mindful of how we use them.\nPhoto by Jakob Owens on Unsplash Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about shoes for a moment. We have plenty of options in the market. All kinds of shapes and materials. All sorts of prices too. But, regardless, the majority of them will be thrown away once they need fixing. If a customer goes to a repair shop, it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely they will be able to get a proper fixing. Maybe a patch if they get lucky. So, eventually, we all are forced to dispose of valuable materials without having the chance to extend their lifespan. In these circumstances, repairing is a very generalist work because it requires knowledge about many different models/brands/designs of shoes and access to a great assortment of fixing materials.\nJack of all trades, master of none,\nbut oftentimes better than master of one.\nWe cannot keep consuming at this rate. That\u0026rsquo;s a fact. We need more generalist workers that can repair and avoid so much wasting. I believe this kind of job is our future because it opens up an opportunity that solves many problems at once.\nIt minimizes the number of resources that we are using until exhaustion.\nIt reduces the pollution created due to the production of new items.\nIt generates jobs that encourage imagination and creativity rather than a sequence of boring repetitive tasks.\nAnd also, general reparation it\u0026rsquo;s usually a local type of business.\nBut what can we do if big specialized companies sell products that cannot be repaired or are too specific to be fixed in a local shop?\nSince money allows you to decide how to approach business, they have all the saying. Conscious consumers might complain about it with their friends, but the average citizen (struggling with inflation and low-wage jobs) can only think about what shoes they can afford. The change has to come from above.\nFood The specialization of agriculture has helped us to improve food production in many ways, but it also meant the rise of monocultures. To reduce costs, large portions of land are used for growing just a single crop. This practice can be very detrimental to a region\u0026rsquo;s soil and ecosystem. Something similar happens with livestock. Animal breeding is much easier and cheaper when done in a big factory. Fewer workers are needed, and transportation is also reduced. However, it increases the need for antibiotics and worsens animal living conditions, not to mention the tremendous environmental impact. This type of business pours enormous amounts of methane gas into the atmosphere and pollutes the surrounding water reservoirs with bacteria from the faeces—all of this without adding the CO2 emissions that its transportation entitles.\nPhoto by Josh McQuaid on Unsplash A food production system where the norm is a small local farm would have many benefits for the environment and society. For instance, it creates more jobs. On top of that, the ecosystems will have the right variety of species to keep a natural balance. As to exemplify, we can think of a more generalist type of farming where faeces are used as fertilizer and insectivore animals, whilst getting fed, are controlling infestations. The following video is a documentary that shows how very possible it is. We only need to share knowledge and patience to build such a world.\nI imagine we would produce fewer quantities of food, at first at least. But I don\u0026rsquo;t see it as an actual concern. Not yet, anyway. Every day tons of food are thrown away without it becoming a financial loss to the companies that own the production, transport and sale of food. It\u0026rsquo;s not like they are sending food to those countries where people are famished. We have a food excess and an undesired environmental impact. I don\u0026rsquo;t see why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t we want to have farms with better conditions, more jobs and less pollution.\nSkilled workers One of the benefits claimed by specialization is better work performance. The specialist has more in-depth knowledge of a particular task he/she is conducting, so the product or service will be of higher quality. This is as much truth as it is a lie.\nIn an ideal specialist world, we have focused workers who know all details of the task, know all the protocols to be followed and have long-term experience doing so. They start and complete the task always in the same way, just like a machine would do.\nIn jobs that are just very simple repetitive tasks, you often find a great amount of low-skilled workers. As they lack the knowledge, they are in the position to make many small mistakes that pile up over time and end up being very complicated ones.\nOn the other side, developing a project or even the maintenance of a business isn\u0026rsquo;t always a simple repetitive task; you often have unexpected problems to solve or complicated improvements to implement. When doing these high-skilled jobs, it is a misconception that you can focus on only one specific subject. In fact, if you want to do it the right way, you need to understand your task\u0026rsquo;s impact on other team members\u0026rsquo; work too.\nSo the downside of specialization, when we look at workers\u0026rsquo; abilities, is that we find a lack of perspective. When you come across a problem, or you are in charge of the design of a project, you need to look at it from above. It is necessary to think of it in a holistic way; otherwise, we tend to make decisions that might very well suit our specialized field, but they might become a huge inconvenience to our colleagues (working on the following task).\nSpecialisation promises an increase in happiness for everybody because it suggests you can choose how you spend your time.\n“If you need a table, but you are good with the guitar, you just make music and get the table from someone else who is good at making them.”\nNo, not really.\nThe satisfaction of the workers (the happiness of us humans) is not so easy to reach in these conditions. Oftentimes, workers are not becoming good at their specialist job because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them happy. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s because they haven\u0026rsquo;t chosen wisely, but more often than not comes the reality that competition is so great that you cannot make money doing what you\u0026rsquo;re good at. Think about an 18 years old human who has to decide what is going to be \u0026ldquo;their specialization\u0026rdquo; for life. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of pressure. I don\u0026rsquo;t blame them if they don\u0026rsquo;t get it right.\nYou might think they can always find a different job, but changing careers is nearly impossible. For starters, you already have spent a lot of time trying to become a specialist in something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t match your natural skills. By the time you figure out what you enjoy doing and what you are good at, you realize you need money to survive, so you cannot leave your job. But becoming a specialist in your newly found passion takes a lot of time that you don\u0026rsquo;t have, and while you are learning, you are not competitive enough to be hired for that kind of job. Yes, it is a Cath 22. Learning this new specialization combined with a \u0026ldquo;hated\u0026rdquo; job becomes so difficult that plenty of people give up on life.\nInternational political game Interdependence of Nations You may open your fridge and see that your mangoes come from Brasil, the jelly from Thailand, and oranges from Spain. You open a cabinet and find a cup made in China and some chocolate grown in Peru. That cabinet was designed in Sweden, and the bottle of wine you are about to drink was filled in South Africa. For us to enjoy all this luxury, our countries must rely on each other trading the goods and services of their field of specialization. This cooperation (interdependence) has considerably improved many people\u0026rsquo;s lives and even avoided escalating conflicts. But it is not as simple as it looks.\nThe real world is much more complicated than our kitchen. Something so trivial as a change in taste or fashion can bring a whole industry to the ground endangering the possibility of a Nations\u0026rsquo;s contribution to this interdependence system. So imagine the consequences when competition comes into play. The labour cost has moved entire companies from one nation to another. Many countries disregard the working conditions of their citizens only to lure big businesses to their land. We have seen how the USA harassed Iran, keeping them out of many trade opportunities without apparent reason. The current situation between Europe and Russia reduced gas trading, and transportation prices rose. It seems interdependence can turn into a toxic environment where power is abused. All that glitters is not gold.\nDeindustrialization At this juncture, deindustrialization becomes a natural consequence. When they choose to do it, a country loses their manufacturing industry in pursuit of services. Robert Rowthorn and Ramana Ramaswamy sustain in their article Deindustrialization — Its Causes and Implications that \u0026ldquo;deindustrialization is primarily a feature of successful economic development\u0026rdquo; because when they look at the domestic expenditure on manufactured goods, this one has remained stable; so they think that \u0026ldquo;deindustrialization is principally the result of higher productivity in manufacturing than in services\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Finally, the paper suggests that advances in the service sector, rather than in the manufacturing sector, are likely to encourage the growth of living standards in the advanced economies in the future.\u0026rdquo; But all of this only happens because their advanced economies are counting on exploitation. The exploitation of their citizen and exploitation of those citizens that live in developing countries that manufacture for the advanced economy. I am saying this because they are totally opposed to centralized wage-bargaining arrangements.\nThese are an Economics Professor at Cambridge and an Economist in the Research Department of the International Monetary Fund who consider that having a minimum established wage that ensures access to basic necessities \u0026ldquo;could have adverse consequences for the growth of productivity\u0026rdquo;.\nI am sorry if I don\u0026rsquo;t care as much about productivity growth as I do about the safety of most of the population. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it matters that Apple and Amazon are American or that Shell and Volkswagen are European if they are not doing anything for the future of their countries (and population). What matters is that when you are sick, need a vacation or want fixed working hours, you can get it as any human being deserves it. Look at this map and see how those countries with higher standards of living also have a more significant minimum wage too: Central Europe, Canada, and Australia.\nPhoto: https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/cyk5fr/minimum_wages_by_countryinthour/ Let me tell you that economic papers like the one I referred to earlier are often opinion based (in opposition to evidence-based). I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is fair for those of us who are seeking knowledge on this topic. Before you analyse the economy, you have to decide what kind of society you aim for. Preparing to write this piece, I came across an insane amount of what I considered misleading articles. Many economists mistake big companies\u0026rsquo; particular objectives with society\u0026rsquo;s general goal. Whenever someone tells you how the economy needs to be in order to function, ask them first about their goals. They might not even have thought about it. Sometimes we just replicate what some fancy dude in a suit tells us to think.\nThe worth of a human, the worth of Earth\nI understand that money is what moves the world. We are nearly 8 billion people, and that\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a lot of people. Ok, I agree. We need some trading mechanism, and money is the best option. But when we focus on accumulating it rather than seeing it as a tool… We forget about humanity.\nDid you know that companies increase their revenue goals every year? They don\u0026rsquo;t contemplate just getting by as they ask the regular citizen to do. We live in difficult times, and still, billion-dollar businesses want more.\nWe have a cow called Earth, and we have milked it all the way. We can give it a rest and hope that will help, or we can keep lowering wages and polluting the ecosystem until it dies. You can listen to the rich economists and dream you will become one of them. Or you can join the educators, health professionals and ecologists trying to find a solution to the problem the pursuit of wealth has created.\n","date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/photo_2022-11-01_12-34-01.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/the_environmental_and_political_impact_of_specialization_in_our_society/","title":"The environmental and political impact of specialization in our society"},{"content":"A poem to patience in friendship Don\u0026rsquo;t you dare break into my soul\nlooking for gems that can be sold\nto warm yourself up when it\u0026rsquo;s cold\nand forget about me when you find a clear road.\nIndeed, I do set a high prize\nfor those who want to see my inside,\nbut you have to understand\nso many times has it been vandalized!\nthat loneliness feels safer than being advised\nwith sharp words in a disguised.\nSo, yes, please,\nhave a bit of patience with me\nwhile I untangle all these weeds\nand find the right strings\nfor playing the emotions I feel.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t promise you anything\nspecial or interesting,\nbut I vow to you I will\nput an effort towards honesty.\nI hope that\u0026rsquo;s enough for a friendship.\n","date":"2022-08-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/photo_2020-01-28_16-13-54.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/gems_weeds/","title":"Gems and Weeds"},{"content":"Photo by Christopher Burns on Unsplash\nAbout growth and scarcity This is the first piece of a series of articles that will explore the effects of a specialized economic system in our society from a worldwide outlook.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s no surprise if I say that our society is profoundly polarised. It\u0026rsquo;s enough to put one newspaper next to the other and see how the same story has two very different approaches, even though journalism is supposed to be a discipline based on objectivity. Through this article, I argue how these levels of polarization are an undesired consequence of specialization.\nThe purpose of specialization During the Industrial Revolution, the division of labour emerged as a way of increasing the efficiency of production. Specialization is when a worker, firm, region or country concentrates all their efforts on producing a narrow range of goods and services to become the best at doing it. Workers specializing in only one task don\u0026rsquo;t need to comprehend the whole process. This condition reduces the number of skills demanded by the job while increasing the quality of that particular step or product.\nFor a specialized economy to work, trade is required. The concentration of efforts on only one product or service increases the availability of this particular one but not the possibility of others unless you trade them. Through trade, you have the opportunity to reduce the scarcity of those things you are not able to produce. You can exchange the excess of your specialized product for whatever products or services you need. To simplify trade around the market, we use money as payment for goods, services or even debts.\nPlenty of economists claim that specialization is indispensable to the growth of society because it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to develop complex products or deliver specific services. When it comes to technological advances, I agree with them on that. Humanity managed to decode all proteins and found a vaccine to help in the fight against Covid in an incredibly short time. That said, I think economists are missing what social growth actually is. I\u0026rsquo;ll get into that further down in the article.\nReduction of scarcity One of the benefits that specialization brings us is the reduction of scarcity. It is often used as an example of growth because it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to give citizens access to a broader range of goods. In theory, it seems true. In reality, it\u0026rsquo;s not so simple.\nThe average specialized worker is often a poor citizen (low-income citizen if you wish to give them a more euphemistic name). While these citizens are a part of the socioeconomic system and therefore are meant to have access to all these new available goods and services, they have not. It\u0026rsquo;s necessary for them to choose how they spend the little money they get, so even if the market has plenty of things to offer, they are not acquiring more.\nSpecialization is not reducing their scarcity but broadening their consuming choices while their life options and opportunities remain the same. An article from WHO reported that according to the United Nations \u0026ldquo;there was a dramatic worsening of world hunger in 2020 … much of it likely related to the fallout of COVID-19\u0026rdquo;. Here we have a good example of how, even though the specialization has helped during the pandemia, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any power to control the real impact of scarcity.\nBut this \u0026ldquo;Covid-period\u0026rdquo; example might lead you to think that this is an isolated issue created by the difficult circumstances that everybody had to deal with during 2020. Don\u0026rsquo;t let yourself be fooled. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a new problem.\nSource: World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) Source: World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) This graphic (left) shows how the prevalence of people suffering from lack of food jumped from 23% to 27.6% in the pre-Covid period from 2015 to 2019. As you can see on the map (2019), the southern hemisphere is suffering the most. It is easy to forget that there are billions of people struggling to get food when you are an economist playing with billions of dollars on a Monday morning. It is easy to think about all the benefits of having thousands of different types of shoes and shirts at your disposal when you forget about the people making them. People who cannot choose what they are wearing or how much they will be eating that very same Monday morning.\nSource: www.fao.org According to an FAO report, \u0026ldquo;an estimated 1 in 10 people worldwide are suffering from hunger\u0026rdquo;. According to the data provided by the UN to WorldoMeter, in 1992 we were about 5,4 billion people on this planet, and now we are reaching 7,9 billion. That means that, in 30 years, the population has increased by 2,5 billion, give or take. Thanks to World Data Lab, we also know that currently, 2,39 billion people are living in water-scarce areas. In 1992, 1,35 billion people were living in such conditions, so today, there is one billion more suffering than thirty years ago.\nHalf of the total world population increase consists entirely of people living in water and food scarcity conditions.\nSince the 90s we have had the internet, we have many sorts of videogame consoles, we have computers like the one I am using to write this article, we have twenty different types of chocolate creams… But can we truly keep saying that trade and specialization can reduce scarcity?\nGrowth If you hear that a county has experienced growth, you instantly think about economic growth. Social growth as a concept doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a proper/official definition. When you search for it online, you mostly get information about personal development or self-improvement. Hopefully, there are some institutions like Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung\u0026rsquo;s (FES) that are trying to analyze the international picture and propose a growth model not only based on economics but on sustainability and justice too.\nThe traditional economist will tell you that measuring growth from an economic perspective is the best way to do it because money is related to all other aspects of life. It is easy to argue that there is very little that you cannot buy, and for those things, money certainly helps.\nFor a long time, it has been said that the general economic growth of a country raises the incomes of the poor and everyone else in society proportionately. In the following video, you get an example of such an opinion.\nSource: Real GDP Per Capita and the Standard of Living https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0qHA93oOSc Alex Tabarrok explains why he thinks Real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Per Capita is the best measure of a country\u0026rsquo;s average standard of living. Real GDP is about the total income of a nation, and, mainly, it grows according to the total production, which has a great connection to the level of specialization of that country. When you calculate the GDP per capita growth, you expect to get a picture of how much the standard of living has improved. As an illustration, he provides some data to prove the correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy or happiness.\nBut just for a moment, think about the impact that the specialization process has on the daily lives of citizens and their countries. Competition over energy sources between powerful governments generates long-lasting conflicts. This means war zones where people lose their lives. Other countries go for a different approach; instead, they allow exploitation in their country so that production can increase rapidly and they can be a competitor offering better labour costs. We cannot forget that, while the GDP of a particular country might increase, the GDP of the competition will decrease because when we look at the general state of the world, we see that scarcity hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped rising; which means it only has changed hands.\nAnd finally, I cannot but think that the primary reason life expectancy has increased so nicely in this period is the drop-off in child mortality; a fact that is very well proven and connected to other factors like the obstetricians washing their hands before delivering a baby. (You can see this in the graphics below.)\nSource: World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) Source: World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) Specialization is the best way to improve production efficiency and, as a consequence, revenue increment. But who is getting all this money?\nTabarrok mentions that the Real GDP Per Capita measurement misses the distribution of wealth, as in the case of Nigeria, Pakistan and Honduras which have similar GDPs while the prevalence of poverty varies greatly. This fact doesn\u0026rsquo;t discourage him, though, because immediately he shows a graphic that seems to illustrate that growth is good for the poor. This statement got my attention, so I searched the paper and looked at it for further analysis.\nHere is a link: Growth is Good for the Poor This paper is not particularly objective. It makes a bunch of assumptions that are then used as if they were facts to prove its theory. Most of the text is a display of a particular view instead of actual contraposition and research. And what worries me the most, the empirical strategy for measuring the income of the poor is very weak.\nSource: \u0026ldquo;Growth is Good for the Poor\u0026rdquo; by David Dollar \u0026amp; Aart Kraay They define the poor as the poorest 20% of the population and given that Alex Tabarrok already stated that the GDP Per Capita doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider wealth distribution I think the research team shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have taken the easy road here as they themselves explained in a side clarification.\nWe understand that the concept of specialization cannot be separated from trade or money, and we get social growth (or an increase in the standard of living) as its supposed great benefit. But when we are meant to measure it, we widely use GDP despite its doubtful reliability. Are we making this mistake intentionally or is it pure ignorance?\nFortunately, it seems like more people are realizing that this might not be the best way of doing it. During a Yahoo Finance Live Show, Andy Serwer highlights that GDP \u0026ldquo;doesn\u0026rsquo;t measure the right things which is to say quality of life and sustainability\u0026rdquo;, and that there are other options to use as a guide when it comes to planning for the future of our countries. He says that countries like Italy, France and Spain, even though they are not always considered strong economies, are very nice places to live as they have invested in health and education for centuries.\nSource: Yahoo Finance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU6WMkILcwc Think about the availability of food. Those countries where the consumption of food that has been processed thanks to the magic of specialization is high are not the best places to enjoy gastronomy. In fact, their cuisine is usually worse, and their eating habits tend to fall toward cheap, unhealthy products. That might be a sign of \u0026ldquo;development\u0026rdquo; but not a sign of an increment in the population\u0026rsquo;s wellbeing. If else, it is the opposite.\nPolarization as an undesired consequence When all this started, I mean, the specialization of services and industries, humanity expected a lot from it. We thought we would have better lives and we would eventually be able to eradicate poverty. Clearly, it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen; because people nowadays work more daily hours in exchange for proportionally lower wages, and again, the amount of population living in scarcity is growing. Not only that, people struggling to get proper food and healthcare in developed countries are rising too. We even thought we could stop conflicts with a good trading deal, but that is proved to have failed, as trade and competition avoid as many conflicts as it creates.\nAll of this is creating a massive gap between people fighting to survive every day and people reaching and exceeding the so-called standard of living, unaware of how many billions are very far from ever attaining such a life. On top of that, we have a matter of perspective. This is a subject that I will get into detail in future articles, but it has quite some relevance in explaining why polarization is an undesired consequence of specialization.\nIn a specialized world, a citizen will learn and build their opinions based on the knowledge that their specialization provides them. It is only logical because we have a limited amount of time and attention per day to dedicate to our development (personal and professional). So it makes sense that in the pursuit of our careers, we focus on achieving a thorough understanding of a very narrow subject. It is great for inventions and discoveries, but it is detrimental when we need to comprehend others\u0026rsquo; perspectives. We spend so much time figuring out life from only one side of the room that we forget that there are many walls and corners. There are even doors that lead to other rooms with a totally different kind of setting. More often than not, we stay in our spot, as it is necessary in a specialized world. But then, we lack the knowledge that would allow us to communicate in a healthy and constructive way with others. Our opinions then get stronger and static, and our perspective shrinks until we see ourselves living in a polarised world.\nPolitical polarization: when public opinion divides and becomes oppositional\nEconomic polarization: a faster decrease of moderate-skill jobs relative to low-skill and high-skill jobs\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if we think about polarization in a political way or in an economic sense. The surge in perspective differences (being the discrepancy in the standard of living or the varieties in the focal point of their daily lives) creates a growing gap between individuals, social groups, regions and countries that is definitely an undesired consequence of our current socioeconomic system.\nThe intention of this article I don\u0026rsquo;t want to demonize the specialization process. In research and technological development, it can even be crucial. But I think we have gone too far without measuring the consequences of it, without questioning where and where not should be implemented. Most of us complain about how fast the world is going. We no longer have time to enjoy just being alive because we are too busy being productive.

He doesn\u0026rsquo;t like sports and he particularly hates football. He \u0026ldquo;sent\u0026rdquo; me instead. I started playing indoor football when I was seven years old as an extra-curriculum activity I didn\u0026rsquo;t choose. My sister wanted to join and I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of being alone with my parents. Of all things I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to choose in my childhood (there is a lot of them), this one actually turned out to be good later in life.\nI learned the basics of football in a very small team of girls and women of all ages. For a long time and due to a lack of younger players, I had to play against senior women. Much older and much bigger than me. I could say I got used to being the weakest, at least, in terms of physical strength.\nI was a very well-behaved kid that did everything I was told to do (because life is a bitch and control is our mom\u0026rsquo;s favourite thing). Anyway, it made me a fast learner. I wanted to be liked and I soon managed to be an average player so the coach (a kind-hearted man with dreadlocks) decided that I should join the boy\u0026rsquo;s team. Mixed teams are allowed until you are 12 years old. I went along with it because people seemed to want me to do it. I would have appreciated seeing my parents in a match, but being part of a team had to be enough. In general, I felt out of place but the fact that they needed me as a player made me feel appreciated. Without I even noticing, indoor football became my sport.\nAt school, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the same Boys appropriated the playground, being football the only sport they wanted to play. Of course, they often refused to have me play with them and they would call me a tomboy when I did. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have friends then so this kind of experience would happen to me and I would take it as the most logical thing. Girls didn\u0026rsquo;t want me around either, they also insulted me. So when the tough guy in the class invited me to play I couldn\u0026rsquo;t refuse. He was a bully who had it going for me… He allowed me to join them because he enjoyed having an excuse to hit me in front of everybody. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand the situation then, I was simply glad I had someone to play with. If I complained, I would get kicked out of the playground. This meant being alone one more day after many, so I quickly toughened up and learned to be fast and sneaky on the field. I guess you could say that some of my best football skills are mainly a defence mechanism.\nThe team of a kind-hearted man with dreadlocks I have continued to play indoor football for years and years. At some point, we created a core team of 6 girls and we got to the regional competition. This is a heroic thing to do for such a team. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have any money and nobody was willing to contribute, so our coach and the parents of a team player would drive us to the matches. I stayed with this team until it disappeared, right the summer before I went to college.\nAfter that, I joined another team, with the most terrible coach I have seen. There was no enjoyment in playing if you were not scoring every five minutes. I eventually left. One day I had a respiratory crisis in front of him, and instead of helping me, he ignored me and asked me to keep running. He is now in jail for taking advantage of an underage girl. I can\u0026rsquo;t say I am surprised.\nThis put me off for a while until a guy I was working with invited me a couple of times to play with his friends. He also invited my husband and we all went. It was very casual and didn\u0026rsquo;t happen more than twice, but it was enough for me to get infected with the football bug again.\nMy husband hated though. That\u0026rsquo;s why he totally refused the next time he got invited but said I would probably be happy to join instead.\nFour years ago I arrived in a new country. When I joined my current football group, I did because they were struggling to find people. On a Thursday evening, I introduced myself to a guy in football clothes waiting for someone. He was also new and didn\u0026rsquo;t know anybody from the actual group. We started with the regular talk about our nationality and such. He mentioned something about how popular football in Spain is\u0026hellip; And when the rest of the guys came, we presented ourselves as newcomers.\nThe beginning was very awkward. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s a woman doing here?\u0026rdquo; I could see the confusion on their faces, but nobody dared to say anything. And I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to mention it. I went for a self-confidence look, and I held it as long as possible. One of them distributed the teams and we just started playing.\nAfter that first match, some guys approached me and congratulated me: \u0026ldquo;Wow, you do know how to play! You are fast!\u0026rdquo; I knew they were hiding that other part they were thinking too: \u0026ldquo;Wow, even being a woman, you can play!\u0026rdquo; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t care any less. At that time, I needed somewhere to exercise. Indoor football has always been my thing, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any female team. So… that was it.\nIt is an international group of people. There are guys from all over the world: Brazil, Netherlands, Siria, North Macedonia, Yemen, Romania, Iran, Tanzania, India, Portugal… As you imagine, each of them has a different idea of a woman, and each one had to adjust to me in their own way. I heard all kinds of comments and saw all sorts of reactions. Some were amazed by me, and some would avoid passing me the ball. But eventually, they all adjusted to the idea that I was just another player.\nWe learned how to play together. We know what kind of tricks the other can do. This connection allows us to understand what the other will do without saying. We care for each other when someone is ill or even missing the matches for an extended period of time. We tease the tough guys and encourage the shy ones. But, still, I am the woman.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t I leave? Recently I heard there might be a club creating a female football team, and I thought about joining. Just for a moment, though. They would be playing outdoors on a field, and I\u0026rsquo;m not too fond of that football. And most of all, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t give up on my boys!\nAfter four years of playing with this group, I have friends there. I would miss our chats, philosophical discussions about cultures, and silly jokes during the game… In general, our friendship. Sometimes I still feel like an outsider, sure, but I must say, it is the place where I feel like it the least. It might have to do with the fact that from the beginning, I accepted I was going to be an unusual player, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t put any effort into hiding who I am as I used to do. Or maybe, at the end of the day, since we are all foreigners in this country, we are all outsiders, and they actually understand my feelings.\nDuring this time, I had the opportunity to see some guys changing their concept of women because of this. Or at least opening their minds to a broader range of feminity. I have learned about them and myself too. My disregard for my physical well-being has been put under the spot since these guys taught me to stop when I am in pain and need care. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I feel like Thursdays have brought me the strength to change certain things in myself, and I think I have to acknowledge it.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s only a few people, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like a significant shift in society, but, hey, not everybody has to change the world. I am proud to be part of this corner\u0026rsquo;s change.\n","date":"2022-07-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/donnycocacola--3pxa1O1zoI-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/why_a_woman_would_play_with_men/","title":"Why a woman would play in a team with only men?"},{"content":"Photo by Enrico Da Prato on Unsplash\nA poem with disappointment You, with me, were there\nwhen the monsters yelled.\nUnder the sheets\nhiding from darkness and scared,\nyou and I, trembling through a nightmare.\nYou talked about dreams so I would forget\nwe were children living in hell.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t feel safe, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t alone,\nor so I thought\nuntil time made you grow.\nYou grew bigger, not wiser; I realised\nwhen you made of me the victim of your crimes.\nI wanted to be your friend,\nbut you only allowed me to be your slave.\nI remember that day\nwhen I couldn\u0026rsquo;t take a breath.\nI was eight.\nYou were twelve.\nAnd the weight of your body\npressing down my chest.\nYou were stronger and unfair.\nYou were my big sister,\nand I, of you, was afraid.\nYou learned as good, even if it was wrong,\nwhat every day they showed in our dreadful home.\nLet me tell you: It was not okay.\nYou didn\u0026rsquo;t know it then,\nand sadly, neither today.\nControl was your greater desire\nso you tight me up with this invisible wire\nto make sure my mind wouldn\u0026rsquo;t wander far\nwithout your voice pulling me back\nto your particular doll house\nat least till my conscious started to rouse.\nWith no heart walked, father.\nWith sharp teeth lorded, mother.\nWith indifference, ignored it, brother.\nAnd between us, a war that we yet suffer.\nNow that I am free\nin pain, I still live\npurging the suffering\nin hopes one day I\u0026rsquo;ll be\nthe woman I imagine\nlies inside me.\nHere is a bloody wound\nof a traumatic childhood\nhealing with the best tools\nwhich are poetry and the woods.\n","date":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/enrico-da-prato-109E2UlwPx4-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/you_grew_just_like_them/","title":"You grew just like them"},{"content":"Photo by Jonas Leupe on Unsplash\nThe frustration of replacing your electronic devices every little time. Our Smart TV Stick (not a brand) stopped functioning after a year of good use. No more warranty, unfortunately. An update of the software was advised and that\u0026rsquo;s what we did. If anything, worse!\nWTF?\nMy husband and I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy \u0026ldquo;luxury\u0026rdquo; that much. When we buy something we are happy with \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; stuff. If a simple product does the job, we don\u0026rsquo;t need a fancy one. But of course, we understand that cheap often means expensive in the long run, so we went for the middle-level option. It was the safe choice or so we thought.\nFirst, it was functioning just fine. No pretty features, but working.\nThen, it started doing these irritating things like suddenly stopping during a movie or showing the image in a choppy way. Wifi is good. Internet connection is not the problem so it must be the device.\nUpdates and rebooting were the solution, for a while.\nAnd then the choppy parts were more frequent, the apps wouldn\u0026rsquo;t start and when they did, it took them too long to show all the movie covers. In the lucky scenario where a video was started, it would run for a couple of minutes before throwing you out.\nThere were no more official updates available. It was unusable. After only a year!\n(I probably look like an old lady hitting the remote control in hopes of getting the battery charged. I definitely know I will be one of those.)\nOk. Maybe we thought this particular Smart TV Stick would do the job just fine and it turned out it didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough capacity to run the updated software. It makes sense, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? I tell you already, that\u0026rsquo;s not it.\nExpensive electronic devices usually come with an extra processing capacity in other to assume the heavy requirements of future updates without sacrificing their performance. You could say that my Smart TV Stick didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough capacity to run the new version of Android that was updated and that was it. A very logical, and plausible, explanation.\nBut in further investigation… Instigated by the fury of a bored engineer and his activist-ish wife… Discoveries have been made…\nMy furious husband, desperate to get his money in value, changed the launcher to a simpler version with only the basics. In plain English, here is what he did: he installed a new menu that manages all the apps on Android but doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that much sparkle around. Nothing more. The application didn\u0026rsquo;t look as cute as before but it did the same work. As I said earlier, we don\u0026rsquo;t care much about fancy stuff. This of course has to be done by someone with technical skills. I am lucky to have one of those at home though not everybody does.\nBy doing this, we realized how many ads were showing on the screen before, ads that consume energy and processing time. It also made my husband think about the services that \u0026ldquo;spy\u0026rdquo; on us, those \u0026ldquo;invisible\u0026rdquo; programs that are always running to check and record every action and decision we take within the device. This kind of thing also increases the amount of work the device does at a particular moment. It means that if you are watching a movie and one of these services starts recording information, the system may overload itself, shutting down the app you were using and interrupting your leisure time.\nSoftware updates often prioritize the collection of data and the advertisement of products over the actual functioning of the device. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to believe it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to sabotage your customers, does it? In any case, my nosey husband had to satisfy his curiosity and try to deactivate them.\nAnd puff! Running like a clock!\nI would like to say we were shocked, but no. We\u0026rsquo;ve experienced how companies design their products so that once they are broken, no longer can be repaired. This is no different case. I wonder how many devices are thrown away and destroyed after an update. You would image updates are designed so that the device would improve and extend its performance. I am not saying they don\u0026rsquo;t make any improvements, but it certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t show in the end product, as you can see. However, it allows them to make more money out of you through advertisements and data mining until they eventually stop giving you the minimum service for which you paid.\nI am happy our Smart TV Stick still works but that\u0026rsquo;s only the case because my husband enjoys fidgeting with this kind of thing. Otherwise, we would be criticizing whatever brand we had chosen while searching for a new device that, over time, would have the same issue.\nWe lose our right to repair because the product\u0026rsquo;s construction doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow it at all. We get tricked into thinking we can use our electronics anymore after unnecessary software updates. And on top of it, they can take our data and sell it to other businesses, so we buy even more stuff.\nIt is indeed a silly story to tell. Still, I believe it is a good example that shows why we, as a society, have to start thinking about developing ethical codes of conduct and regulations within the technological industries. Without laws to prevent tech companies from taking advantage of their customers, these \u0026ldquo;little\u0026rdquo; concerns can grow huge.\n","date":"2022-06-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/jonas-leupe-Fhwg7BrGUpk-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/your_right_to_repair/","title":"Dear customers, here is another step backwards after losing your right to repair"},{"content":"Photo by Zach Key on Unsplash\nIf it is such a great idea, why is it failing? NFT sales dropped by 92%, and nobody is actually surprised. I recently watched a TEDx Talk by the Spanish philosopher Fernando Castro about crypto art and the situation of modern art. This video made me start a conversation about NFTs with my husband that evening, who is a software engineer and a videogame developer. He has been reading a lot about the subject and I, as a writer, have my opinions about art. The discussion turned out to be very interesting.\nSmoke Sellers. The price of empty art. What does Non-Fungible Token mean? When we say token, we are talking about units of value that are given to something, like those tokens you find in a music festival or the chips you need to ride bumper cars. You can get them by paying money. In the case of NFT you get them paying with cryptocurrency. Non-fungible is the quality that ensures these tokens cannot be modified or replaced. This is achieved through a BlockChain (it\u0026rsquo;s a growing list of records owned by no one and watched by everyone) where the NFT data is stored. Each time the NFT is sold it’s like one more element is added to the chain, and verified by a bunch of people to ensure this new content is valid. This system creates an independent certificate of authenticity.\nAll of this sounds a bit complicated but if you keep reading you’ll come to understand that it is actually very simple stuff.\nWhat have we been promised? Art always raises its value during crisis times. This happened too when the pandemic started in the shape of an explosive increase in NFT prices. The explanation that we often got seemed sufficient at the time. We were promised that the NFT market would decentralise the art industry giving artists more agency to get a bigger piece of the cake. This occurs through NFT Royalties, payments that compensate original NFT creators for the use of their NFTs. Artists get a percentage each time one of their NFTs is sold. This way, it doesn’t matter that much if you, as a creator, were tricked into selling your art at a lower price than it’s worth. As an art collector, the system allows you to quickly get your certified digital art and then instantly become unique. That’s how a lazy screenshot of the very first tweet got bought by Sina Estavi for $2,9million.\nHow has the NFT concept been used? Buying a random animal with funny colours for thousand of dollars became really appealing because it has an NFT certificate attached to it. Here is an example. You are walking around Montmartre (Paris) and you come to see yourself in an artist market. You see plenty of beautiful pictures but you are disappointed most of them are just another Eifel Tower. Until you suddenly stop to buy a picture from a seller who, next to it, would give you a signed letter in which she states the details of your transaction. You know nothing about art and decide that this must be a good work of art if she is so caring about the authenticity of the pieces she sells.\nNot understanding the real use of NFT plenty of people saw here a great opportunity to make money. Speculation became a trend. If you were in the NFT market it was because you understood how progress comes. You were just riding the first wave.\nOr was it a tsunami?\nIn the past couple of months, we have seen a huge crash in the NFT market. One-third of NFTs have no value at all anymore and another third are being sold for a much lower price than when they first got sold. Sina Estavi, the guy with that beautiful screenshot with no interesting content in it, is struggling to even get a 1% of his investment.\nBut don’t worry, other people, like Gauthier Zuppier, one of the funders of Nonfungible.com (someone bought the right domain at the right time) seemed to find a more intelligent and profitable way of using NFT. He is even talking about a stabilization of the market. He has a lot of hope about its application in the videogame industry. And to prove that, he has launched a videogame himself. It is certainly not the only videogame that brags about using NFTs but before you finish this article you’ll agree it is all bullshit. All those games would have been the same without NFTs involved. The only difference is that in-app purchases look a bit different.\nI will explain using an online card game as an example. If you are a bit nerdy, you will know Magic, the card game that still sells very expensive physical cards. Now think about an online version that used NFTs. On one hand, you have the value that a specific card has in the game (points, strength, item, power, etc) and on the other hand, you have the value that that same card has in the NFT market (Ethereum, Solanaor any cryptocurrency). The value in the NFT market might be regulated by a Blockchain but when it comes to the value in the game this will be modified by the game developer. So if the company stops supporting this game, your NFT art will vanish with it, as it would happen if Fortnite closes its doors after you had bought a costume there with regular dollars. You can not use these cards outside of this game, you cannot even frame them and put them on the wall because they are digital pieces of art, so you are just paying (in cryptocurrency) to play a game. Totally legit, but for now, nothing new.\nWhat can actually be done with it? Indeed, there has been a lot of talk going on about the application of NFT in video games. Some have argued in favour of interoperability as the future of the industry. The idea is that you could be using your nice NFT-avatar in any videogame. You would be identified by it and it would be, again, unique. Or you could buy an item and use it in any of your games. Unfortunately, as Rami Ismail (great game developer) very well explained in his Twitter thread, it is not really possible to do anything remotely close to it. The complication of making a video game goes much further than any advantages that the NFT might bring. Each particular game has so many details that even games of the same company cannot use the same exact images. Because NFTs can not be modified even the smallest adaptation would mean the creation of a totally new NFT, which invalidates their point.\nWhat is the real purpose of NFTs? As I tried to explain earlier, NFTs are meant to be a certificate of authenticity of a piece of digital art (a file in the form of a photo, video or audio), nothing else. In fact, a detail that a lot of people forget about is that it doesn’t stop anybody from coping that file away. Geoffrey Huntley proves this with his “educational art protect”: the NFT Bay. He collected an incredible amount of files that, at least at some point, have been sold as high valuable works of art and put at disposal of the public.\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash When writing articles, we all search for pictures in Unsplash because unless we upload our own pictures it is hard to make sure we have the right to use them here. When you buy an NFT certificated piece of art you are simply buying the right to use a file that is stored somewhere. Exactly, in a practical manner, the same thing. That is why it makes no sense to buy some art only for the NFT that comes with it. When you are in Montmartre you don’t buy a painter’s letter in handwriting you cannot understand, you buy a picture that you can enjoy looking at.\nWhy are there so many websites and video games surrounding this empty business? The answer is simple. We have another example of the Gold Rush dancing before our eyes. The first individuals who arrived at the place would become insanely rich. Then people would find out about it, and crowds started to show up. Of course, there was not enough gold for everybody, so most diggers only found an unprofitable business. But there were some people who always won. They were the ones setting up shops next to these mining areas. They would earn a lot of money from selling equipment to those who seek a fortune through digging gold. And that’s what it’s happening with all these websites and video games that promise you a bright future in the NFT market. They are playing a different role than all the adventurous buyers, and they are surely going to succeed. They already did.\nNFTs do have a place in the future Before you completely start hating NFTs let me give you my last piece of mind.\nThe technological world is always facing a challenge when it comes to making things work on two different platforms. It is a challenge for users, nevertheless. That’s why we love standards. Remember how happy we became when Bluetooth came into our lives? Or when we started getting all our devices on our personal wifi? QR? It took me a while to understand its advantages, but it turns out QR is the fastest way of labelling physical items with a huge amount of info. You get where I am coming from. NFT can become a new standard, used by artists and art lovers, in order to simplify the exchange of certified digital files. It could be used on platforms such as Spotify or Netflix, without the need for huge corporations or legal documents to back up and enforce the licensing deals. The advantage is that you would know you get the original version instead of a low-quality one and that somehow in the process the artist will get paid. However, I am quite certain there will still be a possibility to illegally download it.\nIf you think of NFT as an authenticity certificate it is easy to understand that it has no value by itself but, instead, it adds value to the work of art to which it links. And that’s why I think it is insane that someone would pay even a dollar for a screenshot.\nUnless it is a clever well thought article like this ;) Here you can buy the NFT of this article and support an artist.\n","date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/zach-key-rKE6rXOl14U-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/nfts/","title":"NFTs: Art and money.

I used to live by the assumption that there was no way out of my suffering but now I know I was already walking the necessary steps. Steps that were there thanks to the public services.\nI was born in Spain (Europe), and I think that had a lot to do with the fact that I managed to survive. My grandparents were very poor, and from the way my parents behaved, you could tell that our family trauma is undoubtedly related to it. They would blame every problem on having no money, and then they would spend long evenings from bar to bar trying to find happiness. \u0026ldquo;We are poor, but we are a happy family, unlike our neighbours.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s the story they passed along to convince me to endure their unfairness. When I asked about anyone who had a different lifestyle, they were always crazy and evil people. When I showed a different opinion, someone was indeed putting strange ideas in my head. For a while, they were winning over my sense of self. I was giving in to our particular family cult.\nMy mother died when I was sixteen, and even though at the time I suffered because of it, I now understand that it also changed things for me in a good way. In Spain, when a parent dies the government gives financial help to the dependent children and to the dependent spouse. My mother was the main supporter so my father got about five hundred euros per month and I was meant to get about two hundred (as long as I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a salary above minimum wage). Since I was still underage this money went to him too until I was eighteen. Even though he would spend it on alcohol and I would have to justify every cent I would ask for food, when I came of age I started getting those 200 euros.\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen in all European countries, but in Spain, when your family has a low enough income you are immediately suitable for a public scholarship, money that you will never have to give back. Not only do the most clever students get them. The grants are designed so that anybody can access education without being wealthy or excellent. And as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t drop out and pass the exams to a minimum level, you will keep having them till the end of the degree.\nAt that point, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t take any more fights with my family, so with a summer job, an orphan\u0026rsquo;s pension and a scholarship under my arm, I decided to go and live by myself. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what I was running from when I did this. I thought if I showed them my independence, they would respect me and treat me better. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of the emotional abuse I was receiving because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of my emotions at all. So I stayed in contact with them, still being their scapegoat. Nevertheless, it was a step forward in a long way to recovery. I started seeing other lifestyles and when I dared to ignore them for a whole day, I glimpsed what safety might look like. I think being able to identify safety is a key point to begin healing from trauma. And I know for a fact, that none of it would have been possible without the public services.\nAfter reading many of your stories, I realised the American \u0026ldquo;you only get it if you have fought for it\u0026rdquo; mentality doesn\u0026rsquo;t take children into consideration. When you punish parents for being lazy and refuse to share with them in the form of public services, you are punishing their children the most. When you ask a teenager in pain to endure not only the abuse of their parents but the abuse of our society too, you are encouraging them to stick with their family traumas. You only have to compare American and European crime rates, drug death statistics or the percentage of people living in poverty.\nI am not saying we have to give money to everyone, but there are ways to make sure some help gets to the children who can still be saved. Supporting young people between 18 and 26 years old to get an education it’s the best way to break the transgenerational trauma cycle. They are already independent of their parents so they cannot exploit them and at the same time, their brain is still maturing. It is the perfect moment to give them a real opportunity. Giving them a “life mortgage” in the form of a student loan and stressing them out in an underpaid job it’s only going to establish what they already know: No one gives a fuck about them.\nAmericans, if you love your children, you should love your public services.

I had lost my mother to breast cancer right a year before that. She gave me a scary childhood because she refused to leave my father to kill himself with alcohol. She told me she needed my father because she didn’t want to be alone once I had gone to college. My mother’s family lived in the same neighbourhood as us. We were in each other houses all the time. I decided that was an excuse. I promised myself I would never entrust a man with my future.\nWhen my mother died and I stayed at home with my father, I felt so lonely. I kept saying that at least I had my brother and my sister; they are much older than me. As long as I had them, I wouldn’t be alone. So when I met my husband, he was third on the relevance line and never to be fully trusted with eternity.\nI spent years battling to survive, unaware of the rules. I gave myself to others in expectation of collecting potential helpers for when my turn of loneliness was to come. I became a nurse to ensure a regular supply of good karma. I disregarded emotions that made me feel weak or powerless, becoming as independent as possible. A few years later, my father died of lung cancer, not liver cancer, ironically. It took me a few days to go back to normal. Then I continued with my life project.\nI did well. I worked my way out of a low-income family to spend my honeymoon in Argentina. Yes. After eight years of unconditional support, my husband finally proved to me that I could start trusting him. I was never very romantic, so my explanation for me getting married was that I considered him the best person to decide for me if I were to be unconscious. Love understood by a nurse, I guess.\nI didn’t have my mother or a father, but I got married with the rest of my family next to me and a whole lot of friends. And I continue building this independent woman that could be anything and care for everyone and never get tired. People used to tell me that I never looked anxious or angry, I always had everything under control and could always squeeze a smile. Now that I think about it, it should have been a huge red flag.\nThose feelings I was storing in my body eventually started to flourish. I was finding it very difficult to deal with my siblings. My job was becoming more stressful than I had anticipated. My husband tried to support me, but I felt he could not understand me. Being a health professional, I knew I had to get help. I did. I ask a therapist to teach me how to improve my relationship with my family. She heard the summary of my childhood, just what I wrote in the first paragraph, and she started to give me advice. She didn’t ask many questions. She didn’t need to know all details about the past, she said. I needed a good family relationship to ensure that, if my husband turned out to be a bad apple, I had them as my backup. I really didn’t want to be lonely again. For a while, I seemed to improve until I hit a wall, and depression was all I ate.\nBut one day, with a different therapist, I remembered. I started to talk about the relationship with my siblings at the time of my mother\u0026rsquo;s death. They claimed they were sick-worried about me, but refused to take me with them away from my father. They used me as their personal assistant. My brother (ten years older) wouldn’t spend time with me, only to eat the meals I cooked, which always had a problem, or if I went with him to help him at work. He wouldn’t give me any money for it, by the way. My sister (four years older) would come every weekend and summer to demand a clean house, clothes, and perfectly cooked food. She would always be in a terrible mood. Most of the time, it was because I existed. It was difficult enough for me to stay living with my father. Why did I have to do all those things? I was only sixteen.\nI did them because my mother untiringly told me I had to take care of my siblings. They are older, she would say, but you can be more mature. I want to think that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t often happen that the youngest child takes care of the older, but something tells me otherwise.\nI cannot count how many times a friend asked me how old my sister was. Given the way you talk about her, they would say, I thought you were the older child. It’s sad to think that although my wedding was filled with people, I didn’t have that many friends that would listen to me, nor I would dare to share any of it with anybody. I was a weird, shady independent woman, I guess.\nI met my husband when I was seventeen. I had lost my mother right a year before that. She gave me a scary childhood because she refused to leave my father to kill himself with alcohol. My older siblings refused to take me with them away from my father and they used me as their personal assistant.\nAfter I started to put together all the pieces, I soon understood. I was always alone, and it is only now that I can openly talk about it with my husband and feel his compassion that I don’t feel lonely anymore. Today, I can understand why my mother would feel lonely with her family around. I, however, would choose to be alone for real—quiet and peaceful (chosen) solitude.\nThey say we are born alone, and we will die alone.\nBut we don’t have to live lonely if we choose the right people to hold onto.

I am trying really hard to recover from my mental illness. I start to tell people that I have one, for instance. But the improvements come slowly.\nI recently discovered a fascinating and ironic behaviour of mine. I always had the guts to go out and do whatever had to be done. I was brave and willing, even if it was scary, dangerous or laborious. I say it had to be done because that obligation feeling moved me.\nI was born in Spain, and there, I graduated as a nurse. There were not that many jobs at that time, so I looked for them abroad. I moved to the UK barely speaking any English, and I started to work there as a health care assistant and then as a nurse. It was hard, but I only had a couple of thousand euros to survive, and I couldn’t borrow it from my family (the cause of my current mental illness). I am not comfortable around people, so imagine how difficult it was for me to learn my way around in a new country and learn a new language, which you can only do talking to people. I was scared, but I didn’t feel like I had the luxury of even thinking about it. Now I know that the difficulties I experience when forming relationships with people (work, friendship, etc ) come from my trauma. Back then, I assume it was one of the many defects that needed to be fixed.\nMy boyfriend decided to come along. I must say I am fortunate enough to have met him. In a sense, he taught me to talk. He always suspected I had some trauma, but I didn’t open up entirely about it until recently. He supported me in my personal way of going through life: fighting myself to attain what I was told must be achieved. I didn’t think I had a choice. I never felt I had one before, anyway. Life cards were dealt, and I was playing, ignoring I could swap some of them.\nChallenge after challenge, I forced myself to become an open person. At least, according to my perception. In reality, I created a personality to hide my past from anybody I met me. I recently talked to a friend who wanted to know what was going on with me. He wasn’t sure if I had a mother or a father or none. I had never talked about them. I always avoided the conversation with some weird joke. That’s how big of a wall I build. Nevertheless, I succeed in my efforts to be “normal”. I functioned as an extrovertive woman and managed to work in a multidisciplinary team at Cambridge Hospitals, no less.\nPushing myself this way broke my mind into two pieces. During this time, I stayed in close contact with my family, receiving from some of them their abuse and from others their emotional neglect. Deep down, I knew their behaviour was not appropriate, but I wanted to be understanding and show how much you can do if you show empathy. My Christian mother told me to turn the other cheek, and I didn’t want to lose hope in its power. I was trying to excel to be seen by blinded people. I was dancing with no audience, and then I broke a leg with only my husband as a witness. For him, it was like listening to opera. He didn’t understand a word, but he could feel the emotions.\nI engaged in therapy, but I kept my mask on, so I didn’t improve much with this first psychologist. We tried moving countries, but ironically this brought me closer to my sister and, therefore, to my pain. As if they waited for the right moment, the demons I was hiding in the deepest of my soul started to knock at the door. I was experiencing powerful emotional flashbacks, impossible to be ignored. My mental energy ran out, and I went full crazy for nearly a month.\nI was raised with the belief that family can not be broken, no matter what. You had to stick with it and forgive everything. You simply didn’t talk about it, and time would leave it behind.\nSpoiler alert! That doesn’t work when no compassion or respect is added to the formula.\nThese two pieces of mind I talked about earlier were: my family beliefs (based on surviving in this cruel, horrible world) and my personality (seeking a peaceful life). Only that my personality didn’t have space to grow, and this mask I created instead was becoming too heavy to carry. I was investing large quantities of energy in it, and it wasn’t bringing me any joy, even if I was doing something that I might like.\nI was trying to put together a puzzle that I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what it was. If there is an advantage to going crazy is that your whole self shutters and you have the opportunity to inspect and analyse the broken pieces before putting them back. That is what I have been doing ever since. Of course, you keep choosing some that don’t fit, but you will notice it much sooner than before if you maintain focus. And this story is about an essential piece of mine. And probably familiar to most of us.\nSince I was a child, I have loved being in nature. I belive most people that are recovering from trauma can relate to this. I feel great pleasure only looking at a sprout or listening to animals moving across the vegetation. I like to pack lunch, walk several kilometres until no traffic can be heard and sit enjoying my crashed piece of fruit and excessively hot peanut butter sandwich. It shouldn’t be too tricky, right? Not after I moved countries twice. Not after I learned two foreign languages. Not after I went skiing down a red line the second day I ever skied.\nBut it has been challenging. I did all those things for someone, with someone or because, out of obligation, I thought I had to. I never did it just by myself because I wanted to do it for myself. My family was happy for me to do all sort of grown up activities, like looking after a drunk father, as long as they benefit from them. When it came to me going out to play around the village, oh, that was dangerous. I must say, safety in Spain is not a concern unless you have a controller mom, then crossing the street on your bike it’s forbidden.\nThese last couple of months, I have been taking time for myself. I stay at home most of the time. When my husband is free, we sometimes visit a natural area, but he is not so much into walking long distances and my dog is small with painful legs so we are bound to that. I could go by myself but it’s as if I don’t feel entitled to go out alone. I walk my little dog around the neighbourhood because he needs to pee. I make sure I clean or cook something every day because I feel like I am a good woman. I try to write further in my next book, feeling time pressure. I don’t seem to do stuff outside if I don’t find an obligation to do them.\nThe other day I was frustrated and going through an emotional flashback when I told my husband I couldn’t spend enough time in nature because of them. Well, that was not taken nicely, and neither it should. I was projecting my inner-child frustration, my fears. After a talk, we agreed I would spend time in nature whenever I wanted. He can work from home and he didn’t mind walking the dog during his break.\nHere I go! I am going to be the adventurous woman that I know I am!\nNo, today the weather is not perfect.\nNo, don’t be selfish, today you have to help at home.\nNo, you are probably too tired for such a long walk.\nExcuses started to pile up. I was not doing what I wanted, and now I could not even blame anybody for it. Maybe I didn’t want it hard enough. Why would I behave like this otherwise?\nStill, the desire for natural adventure remained. So, yesterday, in perfect weather, after my husband ensured me he could perfectly handle everything by himself, and I was so rested that had gained some kilos, I found myself with no excuses and an open door.\nI took my bike, and I cycled to a close-by protected area. Yes, I don’t even live that far from nature. That doesn’t mean I didn’t spend that time thinking: Maybe cycling there and back is enough. Those words… Those words sounded familiar. I am going to keep going and see what happens. I got to the forest and parked my bike. I was happy already. I could hear the birds, and my eyes were filled with green. It was a great idea.\nAnd after a few kilometres, again. Where do you think you are going? This is going to take too long. Sure you have things to do at home. I stopped. I sat down. If you go back now it’s still going to take you a while to get back. You are going to get tired, and then what? Go back!\nI battle myself for a few minutes. I wanted to go further and discover the area that I could never go with my husband and dog. But this voice… This voice wouldn’t let me go. You are a lazy girl, you should be at home working. There are children who don’t even have a home and you are here playing.\nOk, this is becoming a little bit too hostile, so I am just going to ignore the voice and keep going forward. Just a little bit. Maybe I shouldn’t be doing the entire route. I bargained. I will walk a little bit further, and then I will turn back.\nI got up. Where do you think you are going? You are not going to make it. You will come back disappointed and with your tail between your legs. I looked at the path I had in front of me, and I started walking, focusing on the nature around me. Each step took me further—just a little bit. I stayed focused on my surroundings. I began to forget about the voice. I could only hear life. Woodpeckers. Magpies. Blackbirds. Mouses were moving under dry leaves. Treetops were dancing with the wind. Fawns. Oh my god! I saw four fawns on three separate occasions. Each time I would freeze to see them pass by gracefully. It was beautiful. I could feel my energy filling up along with my self-worth and pride. I was finally out there. I was getting tired, but I didn’t care because it was only physically. I was not wearing my personality mask. My soul was light. I felt one step closer to myself.\n","date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2281.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/one_step_further_one_step_closer_to_yourself/","title":"One step further, one step closer to yourself"},{"content":"Photo by Joshua Rawson-Harris on Unsplash\nI can only have a sense of security if… Last weekend my husband and I met another couple for dinner. The guy is always willing to help, and the girl has “empowering people” as her life purpose. Now and then, we eat together and we play a board game. During this time, we talk about plenty of things: the weather, feminism, movies, capitalism, bitcoin, work…\nAnd lately, we also talk about our mental state. On a previous occasion, I told them about the difficulties of living with CPTSD symptoms. I was struggling to be around people, which made going to work a nightmare and I ended up quitting. I was constantly ashamed for letting myself be bullied not only by my parents but by my siblings too until I was 29 years old. It has been more than a year since the last time I saw them, and I still find it very difficult to set boundaries and fight for myself. I am mostly feeling weak.\nMy friends supported me. I didn’t even have to explain my trauma for them to understand that I needed compassion. So when I saw that this girl was struggling, I wanted to help her too.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t get into details in order to protect her privacy, but here is something that she said to justify the fact that she got a full-time job on top of her full-time university degree: “ I can only have a sense of security if I have a job.” Now, this is totally understandable if you think of women trying to win the battle against the patriarchy. However, when I look closer into it, I see people who lost the class war.\nTo be honest, I did the same many times. I tried to juggle everything that I thought a modern woman should be doing until exhaustion. Exhaustion that I recognised when I looked at her eyes. Yes, it is often easier to see what’s going on when it’s not you who is going through it, and I was merely an observer here. At the time of our conversation, I didn’t know what to say, so I simply asked if she liked that part of herself. There was something I wanted to hear, but I couldn’t quite point out what it was. She said she liked it at the same time she agreed she had too much on her plate right now. Then the conversation when in another direction and we didn’t go any further on the subject.\nOnly my mind got stuck on the subject. There was no subject really, but I could not stop thinking about that sense of security she was talking about. I wanted to make her understand that she didn’t have to be afraid. Her husband is a great person who I know will support her no matter what. And us, her friends, will be there if necessary. I couldn’t understand it! I even got frustrated with my inability to help. She has to be able to feel safe as long as her basic needs are met, I said to myself. Then, still frustrated but calmer, I went back to search for a way to help her. I wonder what actually made her feel unsafe in the first place…\nIf you don’t have a sense of security, you have an answer to when it started, whether or not you know it yet. I know my answer, I thought, my family was not a safe place to grow up and that’s it. Some people give me the creeps because of my past and that’s why I always have to push myself to stay calm when I am around some individuals. I analysed her life trying to find her answer but couldn’t put the finger on a particular one. My mind kept searching for arguments or advice to give her. I could not believe I didn’t have a good one.\nGoing around these thoughts I suddenly shouted: Everybody has a right to feel safe no matter what! Every child, every adult, and every animal should be able to feel safe the majority of their day. If she doesn’t need the money and she is already doing something with her life, then, why should she have a job to have a sense of security? It’s not like she could actually buy one. Anyway, we all deserve a sense of security for free. We deserve that much.\nAnd that’s when something clicked in my brain. I, too, deserve a sense of security. My inner child deserves a sense of security! At that moment both my body and my mind froze. For half a minute my eyes watched the air as though some kind of ghost was about to cross through me, or get into me. It must have been a lost piece of self-esteem because at that very moment, a huge weight fell off my back and all the shame for not being able to defend myself seemed to vanish. I realised I was asking too much of myself.\nEverybody has a right to feel safe no matter what!\nI hope I will be able to support my friend as good as she has supported me because I am certain I would not be here without the compassion of people like them who didn’t even have to hear my story to see my pain. They say friends are like therapy. They are, even when you least expect it.\n","date":"2022-04-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/joshua-rawson-harris-md7cCWYVq9U-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/she_deserves_to_feel_safe/","title":"She deserves to feel safe"},{"content":"Photo by Peter Herrmann on Unsplash\nHow trauma changes everything When I was born, my whole family (9 people) were living in an old rented house. Just too many. The space was so reduced that my sister and I even had to share a room with our parents. So, naturally, my mother wanted to give us a better life, a home of our own.\nMy parents were hardworking people so, eventually, they managed to build the structure. Then some basic floors and basic windows made it look like a home. Some friends of the family contributed with old furniture and appliances. There was no luxury, but our needs seemed to be met. Unfortunately, that was never enough for them, not for my mother, anyway. Her dream was to have a three-level house where each of her children could create their very own future homes. This means that most of her energy and attention went into working and looking after the house so it would look a bit more like the ones from the magazines.\nReading those paragraphs I imagine you cannot understand why after so much effort I would reject such a gift from them. And so don’t most of people that met them, because it is only this side of the story that they could see.\nMy father worked hard. When he had a job. The problem is that when he wasn’t working he was drinking. He was an alcoholic without the intention of recovery. And even worst, quite often he would become aggressive to the point of starting a fight. During the day and to the neighbours, a peaceful pitiful drunk. At night, a nightmare that lasted years terrifying my mind.\nAnd my mother. She loved him. Oh, she loved him very much. As with her three-level house dream, she was determined to fix him. She also used to start fighting so that he wouldn’t go back to the pub. She was scared that he would have a traffic accident. So the fighting got more prominent over the years.\nBut he was a boy his parents sent to work on the sea too soon. The rough sea. That wounded drunken boy was stronger than my mother’s will.\nBeing a trauma survivor myself, I get the fact that growing out of a traumatic childhood of getting out of such relationships is not easy but here is why I can’t really forgive none of them. Well, I can’t forgive my father for obvious reasons. He never stopped being a drunk and he died without being present a single day in my life.\nIn the case of my mother, the feelings are very complicated. It wasn’t until recently that I understood how much alienation I suffered from her because I was always focused on trying to protect her from him. And also the fact that she died when I was only sixteen didn’t help, I guess. Under those conditions, you sanctified people.\nI can understand that my mother didn’t mean to create bigger fights, but while she was preoccupied with her husband, she forgot about her children. We should be independent and fulfil our responsibilities (cleaning, laundry, cooking and, of course, studying) because she had no time for us. She was busy being a superwoman. If we didn’t need anything from her we were good. If we needed something, we were selfish. She was doing everything in her power to give us a nicer house and to make us look good in front of our neighbours. “For our good” she didn’t want anybody to think we were poor or to know any embarrassing aspect of my father. And that took energy and attention.\nShe was busy being a superwoman.\nI didn’t care much about being poor. I accepted pretty soon that my classmates had could have stuff that I could not. Of course sometimes was difficult, but I could understand.\nHowever I remember a day when my mother told me we only had 30 euros for the last week of the month. We could only spend 10 on food because the rest was necessary for my father. The funny thing is that she was not financially abused. My father was used to being poor and if he didn’t have money enough to go to the pub he would go to the shop and buy the cheapest wine. She was actually the one who managed the money at home, she had a better job. And that I couldn’t nor can understand.\nIn most toxic relationships, in most cases of domestic violence, women are scared of the consequences of leaving their husbands. They worry they are going to become even more aggressive and dangerous so they kind of grovel for their safety. I always thought that my mother was one of those scared victims.\nThere is a moment in my life in which I finally lost my sense of self, knowing I wasn’t worthy of her love. After a terrifying episode in which I thought my father would kill us, I put my foot down. Yes, I was not even 13 years old, but I did it. I used all my anger and energy into confronting my mother. I told her that I could not stand it anymore and while he was out I prepared a suitcase with his clothes and, ironically, his whole lot of medication. I placed it outside of the door and I locked up the door leaving the key inside so nobody could use another. My father didn’t even try to come in. He left for his parent’s house and didn’t even try to ask for forgiveness to come back. Looking back, I now realise he was so used to abandonment and rejection that it didn’t bother him. He knew his behaviour was unacceptable and expected it to happen at some point.\nMy father came back home after “I gave permission”. My mother begged me and described his wounds until I understood he was a person in need of care. My father’s sister explained to me that their own father was a drunk and she had to look after him so should I do the same with mine. A friend of his came by and did the same. The man was on his personal recovery pad and wanted to help my father. So I did give permission. Or that’s what they made me believe because I had no real power.\nThere is a moment in my life in which I finally lost my sense of self, knowing I wasn’t worthy of her love.\nPowerless it’s how that house makes me feel. Within those walls, my feelings have no room, my sense of safety shutters and love is painful.\nWhat I would like you to understand is that a child can be happy being poor if their parents love them. It might be difficult sometimes to tell them no to things you would like them to have. But it is much worst to make them feel unworthy because you are too busy to give them any love and attention. And when I mean attention I don’t mean looking at them do silly things. I mean listening to their feelings, to what they have to say or to what is hurting them. Because otherwise, you are going to have an adult child with more money than you had and barely any self-esteem (or even a mental illness like is my case).\nI can blindly forgive my parents for their trauma reactions. They are not to blame for them. But at a certain point in your life, you have to become responsible for your own traumas and stop projecting your pain onto others. Nobody else will. Nobody else can do it for you. On the contrary to what many people think, it is not a matter of education or money. It has actually more to do with how much are you willing to leave behind in order to live a peaceful happy life. Sometimes is a toxic relationship, a dream, or wealth—even family. You cannot have it all. You have to decide, or you will lose your mind. And that is pure chaos and unhappiness.\n","date":"2022-04-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/peter-herrmann-IeZekEucsA0-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/my_mother_obsessed_building_house/","title":"My mother was obsessed with building a house that I could inherit, but now, I can’t stand a minute being there"},{"content":"Photo by David Hofmann on Unsplash\nYou don’t know until you understand. All these new phobia words… are they really necessary? Here are my path and my findings.\nI learned how to cook at a very young age. I didn’t have much access to processed food, so I grew up knowing what real fooders nowadays learn on Instagram. I also saw how important it was for my grandfather to lose weight to get a surgery done. My grandmother would remind him every day how fat he was. You don’t care if you die, do you? She would blame it on his beloved greasy food and alcohol. And on his lack of willpower too. I was still a teen when, following TV show advice, I designed a diet for him that allowed him to lose about twenty kilograms (44 lbs). I was proud of my healing skills. Looking after my grandfather and later my mother is how I developed an interest in a healthy lifestyle and why I decided to study nursing.\nAn essential part of a nurse’s job is to look for potential risk factors, obesity being, quite frequently, at the top of the list. As students, we learn how obesity affects patients’ lives and worsens their conditions. We study diabetes and sedentary lifestyle (another two critical risk factors). And finally, we get to understand how to design a diet adjusted to every patient’s needs. What excitement to be able to change a person’s life only by controlling what they eat! Of course, we don’t forget about exercise. But that’s obvious: you get fitter if you move your body. Right?\nRight? I tried it on myself, and yes, keeping a healthy diet and exercising often enough to burn those extra calories eaten on occasions was easy. Like most humans, I love cookies and chocolate, especially chocolate cookies. And sometimes, after eating one, I would eat the whole pack. But if this didn’t happen more than once a week and if I made sure to get up off the sofa a few times a week, I would keep my BMI within range. Just like my grandmother used to say, all I needed was a bit of willpower. Everybody overeats sugar to pace anxiety, and here I am managing it like a pro.\nAnd then… Then my anxiety got out of hand. I wasn’t even aware that I was stressed out. I did notice that I was thinner, even fitter. My colleges would tell me so. Some would even ask me what did I do to stay in shape. Back then I used to cycle to work and, being a nurse, I had quite an active job. It must be all this exercise I am doing. So I adapted my diet to a high energy one, ensuring I was getting enough calories throughout the day. And off you go. I did it again! Proper diet is the key!\nCareful! Pride talking As long as they don’t hurt other people, I value and respect anyone. Even if we disagree on how we should run our lives because I know that the consequences of a bad habit will fall upon ourselves. I just couldn’t understand why people wouldn’t educate themselves on a healthy diet (a balanced diet, not those quick-results diets) and an active lifestyle. With a bit of effort, they didn’t have to be fat.\nUnless… Unless you don’t feel like eating, you are hungry and want to eat, but your throat is closed up like a hose under a wheel.\nYou prepare the best lunch you can think of it. It looks delicious.\nEven swallowing saliva hurts, but anyway, you start eating. You have to eat because if you don’t, you will not get the energy you need. Your colleages look at you while you are eating. Are you not hungry? I smile. I am a sloweater. And I continue eating until I can feel the gagging, stronger at every mouthful. I stop before it is too late. I would rather keep a little inside than eat any more and throw it all up.\nUntil one day, I looked at myself in the mirror, and I saw my chest bones showing off. My face has reached a point in which a zombie would pass by and high five me. I would cry out of tiredness. I was losing myself, and there was nothing I could do.\nIt is only when you accept your vulnerability that you can see the strength in others.\nSelf-awareness is the real key I had to stop working. I had anxiety. I was depressed. Being unable to eat when I was hungry made me feel very frustrated. That didn’t improve things. Doctors would ask me why I didn’t want to eat. I did want to. But it hurt. I had to forget about any kind of diet and eat whatever my body accepted. (Yoghurt was the worst, its viscosity made me throw up before the third spoon. I know, weird.) I would go for walks, to relax, but nothing more. I could not. It took me a lot of work and a few weeks before I managed to get back to a safe weight. And when I did my body was not the same. I had lost my muscles. I was fluffy and weak. I was still feeling uneasy. I didn’t know… And I started wondering.\nSo I read. I had questions, you know.\nWhy is it so difficult to stay on a certain weight?\nWhat if I was misjudging fat people?\nWhat if people who have overweight also struggle with anxiety?\nWhat if their tendency to gain weight works the same way as my “ability to stay in shape”?\nWas I being fatphofic?\nI needed to understand. So I read.\nPhoto by LYFE Fuel on Unsplash Oh, God! All these people!\nHearing offensive comments daily about their weight.\nLooking at plenty of advertisements, unable to buy clothes that make them feel comfortable on their skin.\nBeing stared at every time they open their mouth to get a bite.\nReceiving unsolicited advice, useless advice, all day long.\nAnd I understood.\nIf you don’t struggle with your mental health to start with, you’ll probably do after gaining some weight!\nI looked at myself in the mirror again. I didn’t care about my fluffiness anymore. Shit! I was privileged in today’s society. I was alive, and that was enough.\nMy personal take We are not defined by an image but by our genetics, environment, culture, financial status… Actually, we are not defined at all. We learn who we are and how to manage ourselves the best we can given each individual starting point. Luckily we evolve, but that doesn’t mean we can ever reach that image or keep it healthily in any case.\nEven our health care systems are not acknowledging our diversity. Diagnosis and treatments are based on a particular model, and nothing is researched on the alternatives. Professionals are not being trained, so we often deliver more damage than care. Something has to change.\nWe have to stop judging other people’s lives based on our own experiences because we haven’t had the same experience or the same conditions most of the time. We have to listen more. We have to understand what we hear without immediately comparing it to what we know. Remember: You don’t know what you don’t know, and ignorance is bold.\n","date":"2022-03-02T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/david-hofmann-e_rhazQLaSs-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/fatphobiadidnt_exist_until/","title":"Fatphobia didn’t exist until…"},{"content":"Photo by Alexander Sinn on Unsplash\nThe future is here but unfortunately is not Stark Trek’s future, not yet in any case. We don’t have superintelligent machines that, with a simple scanner, can identify the smallest issue in our body or mind. Instead, we have quite a fancy AI doing some part of the diagnosis job. Not too bad, though. But the rest, all the difficult decisions, data collection, and leverage, still falls under a professional’s responsibility. Or it should. At least, I hope people have learned by now that Google can not be your personal doctor (unless you want to feed your chronic hypochondria to a psychotic level).\nUberization: the act or process of changing the market for a service by introducing a different way of buying or using it, especially using mobile technology. (Cambridge Dictionary)\nThe uberization of healthcare it’s been implemented in many areas, especially care at home. You have companies that provide professionals who help with personal and hygiene care, who give medication that has already been packed and prepared by a pharmacist (they are called blister packs or medication rolls), who give and administer medication that can vary every day, professionals who only take blood samples… You need a service; they have a specialised professional.\nI know this because I myself have recently worked in this area of care. I would go to a house and deliver some particular care service. About ten minutes later, I would get going to the next, driving carefully but fast enough because ten minutes after crossing the door, I should be going to the following one. We, professionals, carry a smartphone that records how much time we spend with each of our patients and on the road. We get our planning with several patients that we are meant to visit that day. If we don’t get to their houses, those people won’t be looked after that day, with all the consequences that it brings. So we are constantly on that spot where we have to decide if we can or cannot give one more minute of our attention to the old lady with no children or to the middle-aged man whose social life disappeared after the traffic accident.\nPhoto by Steven HWG on Unsplash But I am not here to complain about why health care jobs are not so rewarding anymore. What I wanted to show with this little rating is that those people in need of help get many different professional visits with a very narrow responsibility focus and very little time. One of the biggest revolutions in nursing was brought by Florence Nightingale and her way of looking at care from a holistic point of view. We then started to comprehend that a person’s health has to be understood as a compendium of different needs, as later Virginia Henderson got to theorize. So, when as a professional, you only get to see this patient for such a small period of time and with only a subject (service) in mind, it becomes almost impossible to see that person as a holistic being. Even if you get a glimpse of it, you cannot really do anything better than say: “You should discuss that with your doctor”. A doctor who, probably, works under the same conditions and lacks the patient’s data needed to adjust the management of that patient. Because, quite often, a dependent person cannot communicate all their needs, sometimes they don’t even know they have them.\nLet’s look at it from a different perspective. Nowadays, everybody is about self-care, right? When you start learning about it, you realise how important it is to balance your diet and exercise (that keeps you healthy) with lazy entertainment and a sweet treat (that keeps you happy). Of course, you have to think about your mental energy: how much time you spend socialising and alone at your quiet spot. You also start thinking about applying moisturising cream every morning because it is better than waiting for your skin to show your age before its time. And these are just basic healthcare needs that most of us have. Now imagine how much attention is required for a person with actual health problems. If we reduce the time we spend with that person and share this time between many different professionals, I don’t think we are reaching our goal.\nSo when we talk about the uberization of healthcare, we have to understand that if it is well done, there should always be a professional backing every step, which means time. Why do I emphasize this? Because most people think that using an app means that the professionals don’t need to spend so much time with each patient. Think about those websites where, for a fee, you can have a video call with a licensed doctor. The virtual visit is likely shorter than in a clinic, and of course, only your bust is visible (also those other parts that you decide to show, but in general, just your bust). What does this mean for you as a person in need of help?\nWhile it makes life more convenient for those who live in remote places and delivers some care where no help can reach, it’s no substitute for a normal appointment at the clinic. The doctor won’t be able to explore your body properly; that’s obvious, so more frequently than it should, the professional will be missing some relevant symptoms. And this is crucial because we are human beings, and sometimes (a lot of times) when we go to the doctor, we don’t really know what problem we have or what we actually need in order to get it fixed.\nWorking in these conditions pushes professionals to prescribe wrongly, not intentionally of course, but wrongly. On top of that, we have a perfect scenario for those with a drug abuse problem. They can easily fake it for a few minutes while hiding their shaking hands under the table. Instead of getting the appropriate help, they get… well, you know what I mean.\nI am not saying that virtual doctor visits are evil, but maybe, they should only be used as follows up appointments once you already know the needs of the patient you are treating.\nAnd my last point: prevention. Most health professionals will agree: the key to well-managed health is prevention. If you want to be old and sexy, old and agile, old and happy… you have to start looking after yourself today. And more importantly, if you want to avoid expensive medical bills, the same: PREVENTION. But the issue with this is that prevention requires a lot of education, and education requires a professional’s time. The thing is, this kind of time is not as profitable as surgery time, x-ray time or chemotherapy time. Education might mean that you won’t consume drugs anymore, neither illegal nor prescribed. And that it’s even less profitable.\nPhoto by Adeolu Eletu on Unsplash Anyway, it’s not like we can do anything about it. It’s not the professionals, and it’s not what the clients need. It is what the big healthcare companies are willing to provide. If we are honest, we know healthcare is not a service that, adequately provided, gives benefits (financial benefits, I mean; social and human benefits, plenty). So as long as our healthcare systems are private and financially related to some lobbies, we will not be holistic people. We will be problems that need fixing and can be charged for.\n","date":"2022-02-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/alexander-sinn-KgLtFCgfC28-unsplash.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/uberizing_healthcare/","title":"The benefits of uberizing healthcare cover a dark reality."},{"content":"Photo from Eindhoven by Lucía Ferro\nThe Dark Night Of The Soul I see myself\nover and over\nat the bottom\nof a well.\nThe water\nkeeps raising.\nMy chest\nkeeps aching.\nI take\nmy last breath\nand the water\ncovers my head.\nBut the air\nI exhale\ncreates a bubble\nof pain.\nAnd I feed\non the pain,\nbecoming the fuel\nof my internal duel.\nOh, the fight\nit elevates me high\nallowing me to see,\nand more importantly,\nto breath.\n","date":"2022-02-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/photo_2020-01-28_16-13-48.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/awakening_breath/","title":"Awakening to breath"},{"content":"One too many We are 7,794,798,739 people on this planet and a few more astronauts out there. A significant portion of the population already lives in poverty, and the rest is going that way. We have a pandemic that we are struggling to control, and new generations seem to have little hope about their future. We can say that we have reached a point where decisions have to be taken. At least, we, humans, have the ability to assess, discuss and act upon survival situations. We have done it many times, so, why not once more?\nIn the 60s, John Calhoun experimented with mice to study the effects of population density on behaviour. The experiment was called the Mouse Utopia because he placed the rodents in what it seemed perfect conditions. They would have a limitless source of food and reduced infectious diseases. The mice population increased rapidly to the point where they started fighting for the territory. Then, new generations appeared that were not interested in social contact, and they would spend their time eating, grooming and sleeping. You can see an excellent explanation of the experiment in the following video.\nThis research is not easily extrapolated to human behaviour, but it gives us a hint about some of our current problems as species. We don\u0026rsquo;t even have a limitless amount of food, and we definitely have a huge housing problem. On top of that, we have forgotten to take care of some threatening diseases, even though that scientist had warned us for years. And now that we have to stay at home more time than often, we start to notice the effects.\nUntil March 2020, we lived constantly running around without thinking for a moment where we were going to. I am talking about our future as humans. We have clearly reached what Calhoun named overcrowding. Look at cities like Madrid or Hong Kong. Thirty floors tall buildings are the norm and the incredible crowed underground is the paradise to Covid-19. If you want to follow the proper social distancing measures, you are reduced to a few square meters flat that costs almost your whole salary. Yes, we already fight over territories. We also have gone to the next step. We already have a generation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t care much about socialising, at least not in the old common way. The generation known as Gen Z is born in a world were future doesn\u0026rsquo;t look nice. They are often called soft and needy because they publicly show their emotions, and they live attached to a smartphone what translates to different kinds of socialising.\nI am not going to lecture anybody about how they should live their lives. I am quite sure I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how to manage my own. But I would like to leave my thoughts about this matter here.\nAs I said, we have an overpopulated world and a long list of problems to solve. Funny enough, most of them are caused by this overpopulation, or at least, they could be solved if the number of mouths to feed decreases (in particular those challenges to public health and food distribution).\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry. I am not going to suggest that we should leave people to die. That would be unfair, and actually, it is already happening anyway (Siria, Libya, Nicaragua). But, what about reducing the natality? We know there are enough children globally, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to keep making new ones. Why should we think that our genes are better than others? Why would you want to duplicate that unnecessary strange nose? Why spend thousands of dollars to create the perfect child if there are endless orphanages in many poorer countries?\nI understand that some people want to have a copy of themselves to look at it and say: Hey, you are just like your father when he was only a child. But girls! Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest; pregnancy is not good for our bodies, and it definitely has an unpleasant ending. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice to avoid all that pain? I am not saying that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be mothers and fathers; I am talking about something else. I am talking about making adoption a more common practice. I know it is a complicated process. And of course, you have to fulfil some requirements. Still, when you have your own child, you also have to wait nine months, and you should also meet some basic requirements: like having primary education and really wanting your child instead of having it just because it is what everybody is doing. I know, right now that kind of world where you quickly adopt a child is almost utopian. Still, I think it would be great if governments work together to create such a system where no child has to live in an institution, and at the same time, we get to reduce the world population to manageable levels.\nThe ethologist John B. Calhoun described behavioural sink as the collapse in behaviour which can result from overcrowding. We are now very close to that point. We only have to look at the political picture of the great world powers. Will we be able to avoid the behavioural sink, or are we going to jump to it?\n","date":"2022-01-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/photo_2020-01-29_14-48-11.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/are_we_witnessing_a_behavioural_sink/","title":"Are we witnessing a behavioural sink?"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t like being wrong. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s something you and I have in common. In fact, very few people like it (the ones they like it, they are usually funny). Mistakes are the fuel that brings our minds closer to the truth, but they hurt really bad, so we try to avoid them. Some chosen ones find in mistakes something beautiful, and it is when they can use them as raw material for jokes. But if you are just a regular person like me, funny only when there is an eclipse, you will appreciate what I have to tell you.\nThe truth is only a concept, and it is different for each one of us. We tend to think that there is only one possibility, but life has plenty of meanings depending on which glasses you use to look at it. We could say that our truth is a bunch of beliefs that we have and we do not question, at least not often. And it is this group of beliefs to which we compare any new information that we get. But what happens when we get proof that one of those beliefs is mistaken? That\u0026rsquo;s when we go through the \u0026ldquo;experience of error\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;We can be wrong or we can know it, but we can\u0026rsquo;t do both at the same time.\u0026rdquo;\n— Heisenberg Uncertianty Principle of Error —\nThink about the last time that you realised you were mistaken. Think about that piece of information that turned out to be an error in your beliefs. And now, think about how you tried to avoid reality.\nI am particularly good at that. I have a lot of imagination, so I am really good at finding excuses to argument my mistakes. Nevertheless, we all humans have a common set of strategies to do so. We usually start denying whatever is in from of us. \u0026ldquo;These trousers have shrunk. I did not put four kilos in a couple of weeks. I am not eating like a pig every two hours. I am not…\u0026rdquo; It is so easy to deny the reality that half America voted for Trump and most of them still support them.\n\u0026ldquo;Our capacity to tolerate error depends on our capacity to tolerate emotion\u0026rdquo;\n— Irna Gadd —\nWhen denying it is not enough, we start to be angry at those who show proof of our errors. We see people with different opinions as to our enemies. They are threatening our beliefs, after all. In this case, it is easy to see then as ignorants. You can see yourself thinking about it sometimes. I am sure you have a colleage at work that seems a complete idiot just because he usually has a different opinion than you. He might be an idiot, but he might also be someone who can show you the truth that you are struggling to see. This denying behaviour is widespread between religious people who often think that those who do not follow their beliefs require education or are just plain evil.\nIt is very dangerous to drive this road. If you dismiss other people\u0026rsquo;s ideas only because they might hurt your set of beliefs, you can make even more mistakes, and some might have great consequences.\n\u0026ldquo;When the facts change, I change my mind . What do you do, sir?\n— John Maynard Keyne —\nWhen we don\u0026rsquo;t want to accept our mistakes still noticing their bad smell; we tend to justify ourselves with all kinds of arguments. Usually, we start undermining the consequences. \u0026ldquo;It is not as bad as it looks. It could have been worse. If I had it done right I could have happened the same…\u0026rdquo; If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t convince us, maybe because someone gave us an irrefutable proof, then we start blaming others. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know because someone told me wrong. I was almost right, and if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t because of that little detail, I would be right. It is not my fault that things are not the way they should be.\u0026rdquo; You name it. We find excuses for anything and the most impressive thing of all is that they are always the same: I don\u0026rsquo;t want to admit my mistake.\nBut then, it finally comes: the moment we realise we were mistaken. It is beautiful and horrifying at the same time. You get a new belief that brings you closer to the truth, closer to see the reality the way it actually is. And it does it throwing you in a pool of embarrassment and self-pity. No wonder why we don\u0026rsquo;t like it. And it is also why it is so difficult to be funny. You really need to be aware of this and be able to take all that crap that seems to overflow that pool and make gold out of it. But when you do. Oh, when you do. You actually learn. You find lessons in those bad moments. And at some point, after eating a lot of shit, you end up looking at error as a tool to improve your life and not as a punishment for being yourself. Because that\u0026rsquo;s the problem nowadays. We search for error to make people feel worse when it is ourselves that we don\u0026rsquo;t feel good enough. And it comes all down to the fact that we don\u0026rsquo;t accept our own errors.\n\u0026ldquo;No amount of self-improvement can make up for any lack of self-acceptance\u0026rdquo;\n— Robert Holden —\nAccepting our fallibility is what allows us to learn and improve as human beings. No one is born perfect, and no one has learned everything that there is to learn. That is why error is so important in our lives; it challenges our beliefs and shows us our own path. If we think that we can\u0026rsquo;t make mistakes, we will never get better and if we are scare of mistakes, we will never take risks that can potentially be very beneficial to us. It is understandable to be attached to our beliefs, but we should also understand that they are subject to being wrong. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we are bad people or that we are broken. It means that we have yet a lot to learn, which is not only natural but exciting.\n\u0026ldquo;The root of suffering is attachment\u0026rdquo;\n— The Buddha —\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at it from a nicer perspective. When we go on a trip to a new country, we know that there will be plenty of new stuff that we don\u0026rsquo;t know about. We read about the history of the place or the gastronomy, but we are still aware that everything will be new to us. Yet we don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly how new and different it will be. But we don\u0026rsquo;t really care because that\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of travelling: learning new things and getting to know new cultures. Now let\u0026rsquo;s think about it changing the new country for a new person with different beliefs. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to like the whole thing. Maybe some beliefs don\u0026rsquo;t make sense to you. But we all should keep our minds open to realise that someone else\u0026rsquo;s beliefs might be better or righter than our own. It is only this way that we get to experience being wrong as excitement. Similarly, we don\u0026rsquo;t see the error as suffering because we can easily let go of those old beliefs and make space for new ones. So, open up your mind and error as much as you like.\n","date":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_2675.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/errors_make_us_human_and_funny/","title":"Errors make us human, and funny"},{"content":"On the 17th of December, the Spanish government reviewed and approved the proposal of law on euthanasia. Within the Congress of Deputies, not everybody was a supporter, but general surveys say that most Spanish people were in favour of it. What does euthanasia mean? Euthanasia is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve chronic pain and unbearable suffering. Up to this point, only The Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Luxemburg and Canada have laws to regulate this kind of practice. Some others are in the process of doing it, and some have legalized a similar practice called assisted suicide (in which case are the people who want to die the ones who put an end to their life).\nI nice memory to hold on to.\nWho proposed the law? The limitation of therapeutic effort or the palliation of pain are not only options but they are patient\u0026rsquo;s rights recognized by the law. However, this was not enough to solve the issue behind a dignified death as it is shown in the movie Mar Adentro (The sea inside, 2004). Since then, euthanasia has been a matter for discussion between Spanish people, even though that, the law was not proposed until 2019 by the leftwing party Unidas Podemos. Unfortunately, it was not even voted for due to the instability of the government back then.\nDuring the last few years, Spain has seen how several patients publicly demanded a law for euthanasia creating even a platform called Derecho A Morir (Right to die), in which they could register their wishes as to how they wanted to die in case they lost their ability to decide for themselves. This organization also helped to educate the population in any matter related to a dignified death, such as palliative care or the writing of a testament.\nAll of this and the famous case of a couple who videotaped what then was an illegal euthanasia helped bringing the subject to the surface. All Spain watched how María José Carrasco, suffering from MS, discussed death with her husband Ángel Hernández several times before he administered the medication that would give peace to his wife. He was then charged with a crime of cooperating with suicide but fortunately didn\u0026rsquo;t have to go to prison and could continue his fight. Today he still misses his wife but he is proud and happy to see this law finally came through.\nWhat will it be like? First, only patients in a severe, chronic and disabling condition can apply for euthanasia. The patient has to be well informed about what euthanasia means before any process is started. The application must be handwritten or declared by other means that can be recorded, and must show that is not the result of any external pressure. It must be repeated fifteen days later in order to avoid any changes of mind. Once the application is fully submitted two doctors will review the patient files to discard any mental issues and afterwards a commission will consider the case. Once it is approved, professionals have the option to invoke conscientious objection.\nDeath, a human right A dignified life is something we all deserve by nature, but what does that mean? The idea of a dignified life is associated with the existence a person can lead when their basic needs are satisfied. By contrast, those who cannot meet these basic needs cannot have a decent life. And what sense does it make to live if you have no control over your life?\nEuthanasia, a dignified death, is a human right and therefore it should be respected. This 2020 more than ever we understand how important is to talk about death and its meaning. When we talk about death we are talking about human dignity and human suffering. This two subjects are delicate and avoided more often than they should. Allowing people to decide for themselves is the least we, as society, can do for each other.\n","date":"2021-12-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/eitanasia.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/spain_finally_legalizes_euthanasia/","title":"Spain finally legalizes euthanasia"},{"content":"Photo: OMG how dare you! by Lucía Ferro\nFirst of all, I am going to speak about these two subjects from a European point of view since I am Spanish and I have lived in different EU countries. I wanted to clarify this because I understand that both jobs are seen in very different ways depending on your origin and experiences. I am also going to identify myself with a feminist and I am going to happily hear other opinions.\nMoney I have probably heard a million times that nursing is a very rewarding job. Of course, you do it because you have this incredible deep vocation towards care. Because, you know, specially if you are a woman, you are meant to love caring for others. I didn’t want to say it, but… female instint… Bullshit. Maybe you chose nursing because you like biology and all those medical stuff. Maybe you even find in nursing that human contact that you seek. But, let’s be real, nursing nowadays is not about caring anymore, it’s about keeping your patients alive until the next team comes and takes over. So, yeah, you are just there for the money because if you really care about your patients your instints are to start shouting at your boss asking them to put more nurses on the job. What I am trying to say is that maybe, each case is different, but maybe, prostitution would give nurses more money. Just saying…\nBad hours Now, this one is outrageous. Believe me when I say I would rather put on a nice dress, make up and all that jazz and go out for some drinks than to be like a zombie searching for tablets in the dark or jumping every time a lost patient asks for directions from behind a curtain. Nurses don’t have those free period days. When a prostitute has her period, well, she has an excuse. When a nurse has a bit of fever, well, she has lots of colleges talking about her laziness. It’s not because they don’t have good relationships, usually it’s the boss who puts that kind of thoughts on them. “If she really has a fever, of course I don’t want her to come. But, does she? Or is it just a headache?” You know what! I have something to say. If a nurse has a headache she should be entitle to have a day of rest. And you know why? Because nurses have to deal with lots of headaches that are not really their problem. So I would say, before they are ready to handle anyone’s health, we all have to make sure that those lazy nurses get their shit together and get rid of their fake-headache.\nWorking environment Hear it comes. This is the right moment for you feminist to tell me I don’t know shit about what a woman deals with when she has to work as a prostitute. To be fear, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in their shoes. And being honest, working as a nurse almost made me go crazy so I guess I would agree with you guys and say I don’t know shit about it. But just because I love giving my opinion I am going to say that a nurse hears plenty of sexual quotes that you wouldn’t expect to hear in a hospital. Also, nurses deal with very weird stuff like people hallucinating or bleeding like in a Tarantino movie. Nobody tells you about it until it’s too late for you to run and find another passion. Let’s admit it, nurses. We just trick people into thinking that nursing it’s a beautiful job just because we need more people on it.\nAnd that’s just one more reason to criticize nursing. Everybody in the hospital is trying to survive the day. Very few people can actually handle it like pros, so very few people help you without neglecting their on health. Sometimes you get helped but mostly because there is this tribe kind a thing where a certain group of nurses have their own club and they help each other and of course, again, they talk bad about the other tribes. Just the same kind of bullshit you get in any other job.\nDignity And the last but not least: Dignity. The word that seems to solve so many religious problems and makes us think that nursing is far from prostitution. According to the Cambridge Dictionary dignity can be “the importance and value that a person has, that makes other people respect them or makes them respect themselves”. I agree with it. To me it is all about respect.\nIn the other hand, if we search in a religious dictionary like the Merriam-Webster we find a slightly different definition: “the quality or state of being worthy, honored, or esteemed”. In this case we don’t have an answer about who is judging you, but I would imagine they think is God. Just a big guy dealing respect cards to people.\nDignity in prostitution is constantly questioned. Why I woman would give pleasure to another human being just for the fun of it? Why would she do oral sex if she doesn’t like the guy? Why would she prefer to do this job than to work as… a nurse? Maybe because when you are a nurse you have to clean someones ass just for fun. And not only their ass, also you have to clean all those tubes that go up there while the disorientated patient yells at you because he thinks you are raping him. Or worse, you have to make sure he keeps his hands in his pockets because you don’t want another unwanted slap in your ass. Why would she prefer to do this job than to work as a nurse?\nMy answer is clear\nLet those girls do whatever they want. Just make sure you properly regulate their job conditions so they are not in a dangerous work environment.\n","date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_8815.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/what_nursing_prostitution/","title":"What nursing and prostitution have in common?"},{"content":"The Power of Music In fact, I am listening to him right now.

For that matter, I have found wellness.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll explain. Sometimes, after I have written a post, I enjoy adding at the end of it a link to just one song. I imaging that I am choosing a nice soundtrack that helps the reader to reflect on whatever subject is discussed. It is also a great excuse to spend time listening to new music.\nA few weeks ago I wrote a post about sustainability while buying clothes. This led me to search for a song that would profoundly talk about clothing. Yeah, I love getting a bit intense. So after going through some funny ones like Boogie Shoes by KC and the Sunshine Band I eventually crashed against The girl in yellow dress from David’s album Rattle that lock. It turned out to be one of those compositions that climb directly to your favorite’s list: because I love its jazzy style and because the lyrics are a beautiful poem. I don’t know how the composition happened but I would like to blame his writer wife Polly Anne Samson for it. I just adore the romantic idea of a loving couple working together.\nSince then I learned lots of things about David Gilmour. Although he is just a part of Pink Floyd history he is considered one of the best guitarists in the world by renowned magazines like Rolling Stone or Guitar World; being responsible for some of the best guitar solo’s ever composed. On top of that, he is an actual aviator (yes, with a plane) and a knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. This last achievement might seem useless but it sounds cool at a family dinner.\nHowever, it wasn’t a single song or an interesting life that made me get hooked to David Gilmour music. The best of listening to his art is meditation. Thanks to his music I am learning to enjoy lying down and moving nothing. I might have chosen to be a writer but I am not a sitting-down-person. I am the kind of girl whose body needs to feel exhausted before I feel that I deserve a rest. Just a regular young woman trying to, excessively, proof that ‘yes, we can’. What I mean is that I am one of those who struggle to learn meditation or any other concentration practice. And that’s why I got so excited about his third solo studio album On an Island because it was when I listened to it that I understood I was able to focus. I started listening to the different instruments, one by one and each with its particular pattern. I would pick up a gentle sound and I would concentrate on it as if there were no other instruments. Then I would jump to the next one and let myself go with the flow. After a few songs, I was still there: meditating and motionless but not exhausted.\nDavid Gilmour’s album On an Island has given me not only peace but the capacity to travel within that precious and scary world that is my mind.\nSPOTY MEDIUM ","date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/gilmore.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/david_gilmour/","title":"I can't stop listening to David Gilmour"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t have a picture of a wild pig so here you\u0026rsquo;ve got a picture of a cute dog. It’s almost midday. A group of men arrives to the settlement carrying a wild pig dripping in blood. A few children welcome them amazed by the large hunt. Deeper into the settlement a woman prepares the fire. They know: Today it’s a feast day.\nWe often think about ourselves, humans, as aggressive, natural killers. You only have to look around and see the world. Some people would also consider that killing other animals is just a survival impulse. However, there are other noteworthy opinions. Donna Hart and Robert W. Sussman argued in his book Man the Hunted that early humans evolved not as hunters but as preys of many predators. They studied the Australopithecus afarensis, which lived between 5 million and 2.5 million years ago and is one of the better-known early human species. It seems that they were small and strong like any other primates and that they mainly ate fruit and nuts. The point here is that they not only didn’t eat meat but that they were not even dentally prepared to eat it. They didn’t have sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods, so why would they hunt? Sussman and Hart’s anthropological studies show that it was not possible for early humans to consume meat until fire was controlled and cooking was possible, which it is dated to have happened only 800,000 years ago. “In fact, some archaeologists and paleontologists don’t think we had a modern, systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60,000 years ago” said Sussman in an interview with Niel Schoenherr for the Source. It doesn’t really seem fair to say that hunting is a part of human nature. So, how did we became hunters after living so long as prey?\nAs Ker Than very well explains in his article for LiveScience: “The theory of evolution by natural selection, first formulated in Darwin’s book On the Origin of Species in 1859, is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and have more offspring.”\nIn his book The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins explains very well what it means to be born a prey in a world where the only thing it matters is survival. Because I don’t think I would put it in better words, here is a piece of it:\n*The currency used in the casino of evolution is survival, strictly gene survival, but for many purposes individual survival is a reasonable approximation. If you go down to the water-hole to drink, you increase your risk of being eaten by predators who make their living lurking for prey by water-holes. If you do not go down to the water-hole you will eventually die of thirst. There are risks whichever way you turn, and you must take the decision that maximizes the long term survival chances of your genes. Perhaps the best policy is to postpone drinking until you are very thirsty, then go and have a good long drink to last you a long time. That way you reduce the number of separate visits to the water-hole, but you have to spend a long time with your head down when you finally do drink. Alternatively the best gamble might be to drink little and often, snatching quick gulps of water while running past the water-hole. Which is the best gambling strategy depends on all sorts of complex things, not least the hunting habit of the predator, which itself is evolved to be maximally efficient from their point of view. Some form of weighing up of the odds has to be done. But of course we do not have to think of animals as making the calculations consciously. All we have to believe is that those individuals whose genes build brains in such a way that they tend to gamble correctly are as a direct result more likely to survive, and therefore to propagate those same genes.\nNow we know that, the same way other animals do, we survive through gambling. But, why is the human being so good at it? You are better at gambling when you are able, in a certain way, to predict the future. Animals are not born with this quality and humans, in general, aren’t natural clairvoyants. We are all born knowing nothing and then we learn. So the most common way for an animal to foresee the future is through their own experiences. An individual has to try a strategy which then will be revealed as good or bad or, as better or worse than the previous try. This way the individual, through gambling, will create a better strategy. But what happens when an individual has the capacity to simulate the future in a safe environment before trying it in real life? That would make prey much more challenging for a hunter. Simulation, or better known as imagination, is a very human quality and the key to our survival. We build a possible scenario in our mind and we play the game over and over until we find a strategy safe enough for us to try. That’s what has actually made us stronger and more adaptable.\nMost humans nowadays still don’t hunt and they can even live barely eating any meat. Our creative modern life allows us to produce plant-based substitutes and get them anywhere around the world in a matter of hours. Surely humanity has had rough times getting food and we had to resort to hunting. But, given our current situation where excessive meat production is threatening our species and ecosystem, it would make much more sense to find a brand new way of feeding ourselves that doesn’t imply killing or violence in any way. After all we already conquered the food chain. It is our turn to give something back to Nature using those amazing abilities to imagine that Nature gave to us in the first place.\n","date":"2020-10-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/oca.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/what_makes_us_humans_doesnt_makes_us_hunters/","title":"What makes us humans doesn’t makes us hunters"},{"content":"There are so many versions of marriage that I had to make up my own. I was 25 years old when I got married to my high school sweetheart. At the time I thought I was too young to tie up myself for life. But I did it anyway because I had no doubts about my relationship. Some people told me that it was a good age to have kids, so I was doing the right thing. Other people congratulated me politely and didn’t really care what I did with my life. A few were very surprised that a young feminist like me decided to take such a step. I don’t know… I don’t think that marriage has nothing to do with age, kids or feminism. I think that history has given us very bad examples of marriage and now we seem to only look at it as good or bad. No human connection is that simple. No important topic of our life can be put that way.\nI wonder why feminism has hard feelings towards marriage but at the same time most people want to find the right person to have a serious relationship with. I do understand their arguments against the official union. Traditionally and still in many cultures, when a woman gets married goes from being the property of the father to be the property of her husband. There is no freedom there. One proof is the fact that she is being walked down the aisle by her father. In this scenario the woman isn’t making any decision; marriage is not her decision, it is an imposition. Luckily I got married in Spain and there we signed a different kind of contract. Both parties have the same rights and obligations making no difference between men and women so marriage is just a contract were you make official your serious relationship. You should not be losing anything, you just get whatever benefits the state gives to married people.\nBecause I don’t think I am in the position to talk about married in countries where women have no rights, I will stick to those aspects that have nothing to do with politics but they are related to the cultural beliefs running my nearest society.\nI should probably start with the Disney fantasy that makes us feel that soulmates a real thing. Unfortunately when those two bags of DNA got together they were not thinking about your prince charming. They were just trying to bring one more human being into this world. If the gen combination doesn’t work, maybe next time it will. And that’s the same with soulmates. If “the one” doesn’t work, maybe next time it will. That’s why instead of talking about my soulmate I rather talk about my very best friend with enormous benefits. That way you get a more faithful picture.\nAnother tradition that has gotten lots of attention thanks to the romantic love concept shown in films is the engagement rings. Nowadays it seems like you can’t get engaged without a big stone in your finger. On the other hand it is more common the idea of seeing engagement rings as decorative handcuffs. To some people they represent the destruction of your autonomy and an agreement to put up with the whatever the future brings. I don’t see engagement rings as nothing else than a gift. You are going to ask someone to get married, it seems a good idea to me to pose the question with a nice present. In my case I was the one being asked, so I didn’t have to think about it. However my fiancé then, did. He didn’t understand the silly thing of having two rings, one pre and another post- wedding. So he refused the idea of buying me an engagement ring. What he did was to watch me during a few weeks until he realised that I needed a watch and kept on postponing to buy one. Better than an expensive gift is a functional gift, not because it’s useful but because it shows an effort from his part. You know that person really understands you.\nSo now you are engaged and the money worries come. You have an expensive wedding to organise and on top of that, you know that the couple never enjoys the party… I just don’t understand why the fact that you want to get married means that you have to make a big party. Every couple should have the freedom to decide and if a picnic suits better your pocket, then it should be a picnic. Actually I will raise the offer. Make it a small gathering with your five closest friends and have a lovely honey moon camping. That was in real life my first idea, then I had to admit that I had chosen a party lover and that I couldn’t mess around with the best day of his life. So I end up doing a huge party, but that was my decision made with total freedom. And yeah… I did have lots of fun.\nHaving fun during your wedding is also important. Struggling to make a fabulous party and then having only stressful memories it’s a total waste of time. If you enjoy organising events, go for it. Do your best job and be proud of it, but that day you just have to agree to some mess to happen. Remember that it is not what life throws at you but the attitude you chose to wear when you confront it. So if someone smashes the cake on the groom’s face make sure you are there to have a bite out of your sweet sweet spouse.\nMaybe you’ve survived the wedding. Your pictures are awesome and you just moved a new wonderful house. Oh, oh… Were you to living together before getting married? It’s definitely not a requirement for a peaceful marriage but it will give you a hint of how your relationship is actually doing before jumping into the water. I don’t think it’s necessary to share the living space more than a year, but signing a cohabitation agreement before giving it a try… well, it just seems a little bit too much like romantic love to me. Hey, maybe you two can get away with marriage and not living in the same house. Why not, anything that is good for you two it is good for the couple.\nWhen you sing those papers you automatically become a family. I guess that’s why so many people assume that I was getting married to have children. I am going to be honest and tell you that I did feel a bit obligated to have children, only for a few seconds, though, every time that someone mentioned it. Lots of times. When I got married I had no idea if I wanted to have children or not. For god sake, I am 28 years old, and I am still thinking about it. That’s a problem right there. If you really want to have children and you just pick the first available person in line you are likely to make a mistake. And if you get married for love and then have children, maybe also for love (it wouldn’t be the first time), of course you are going to hate your marriage and your partner and your live. That’s what happens when we do things that we don’t really want to do: just plain unhappiness.\nAnd it’s when unhappiness appears that you wonder which kind of ending you got. Perhaps you were counting on a clean road after your wedding, and some holes appeared that you are just not able to fill. You are in front of the mirror and you don’t know who you are looking at any more. Or is it your partner who seems to have changed more than you thought it was possible? If your are worried that your are not going to get a happy ending, don’t worry: marriage has no happy ending, your significant other is going to leave you one way or another. It can be a break up or a car accident, or he/she might peacefully die just when you feel most vulnerable in life.\nIt is good for you both to keep in mind that that’s the life you have chosen and not the only life you can have. If you understand this you will enjoy every moment and you will run away soon enough whenever it’s necessary. Remember when I said that anything that is good for you two it is good for the couple? Well, it is still true, but there is a hard true to it that you may not like it: divorce. We all make mistakes but we still deserve to go on with our life.\nAnd the question still remains. Why the fuck would you want to get married?\nYou know when you feel that you disappointed someone many times and also you have used your worst manners to hurt that person deeply but nothing seems to drive that person away. And the weirdest thing is that he or she forgets all those things and help you to be a better version of yourself, not in a manipulative way, but with compassion and understanding. You know, growing up together, helping each other to become more mature, supporting each other through dark times and all that shit. I know, I know, it sound very much like a friendship. But I like to think of it like a friendship that everybody needs and most people can’t live without. Sure, marriage doesn’t give you that, but if you have it, why not to get married?\nThe thing is we often have a lot more patience with our friends than with our partners. We expect them to be there for us anytime and we get angry if they aren’t but we regularly forget that we should also be willing to live through out their crazy mood. Being compassionate it has always being difficult, nowadays even more since you get constantly reinforced by the social media of how special you are. But we should try and, consciously, make the decision to choose to love your significant other every single day. If that is not what you want to choose to do, then you haven’t found your “very best friend with enormous benefits”. Or… you still need to grow up, which means you need someone to help you and support you in those very dark times. So, why don’t we try to be nice to each other and every now and then, maybe when you are not completely sure about your arguments, just give in for the common good. At the end of the day, marriage is and has always been a business contract. Buy a ring or throw a party to celebrate your business if you want. But please, be nice to your business partner and I assure you you will get those enormous benefits.\n","date":"2020-10-11T17:06:15+02:00","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_1722.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/posts/the_good_and_the_bad_marriage/","title":"The good and the bad marriage: is it really a matter of perspective?"},{"content":"Photo: Simple wild life by Lucía Ferro\nA poem about the past I woke up\ntired from last night.\nThe breakfast doesn\u0026rsquo;t go down\nthrough my irritated gut.\nI am nauseous.\nI throw up,\nready for the bus\nto pick me up.\nI sit alone.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to chat.\nI want to sleep but\nI have things to think about.\nToday the bully will strike,\nand no one will hear me shout,\neven in a crowded playground.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t wait to come back\nto a home where I can cry.\nInstead, I found a house\nwhere no one would hear me out.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for me to grow up,\nand I just learned how to add and subtract.\nAnd again comes the night\nwith another fight.\nMy mother is angry\nbecause my father is drunk.\nFatigue is settling in.\nI am no longer a child.\nBut, hey, at the end of the day,\ntoday, I survived.\n","date":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://luciaferro.es/images/IMG_1309.jpg","permalink":"https://luciaferro.es/en/poems/one_day_at_a_time/","title":"One day at a time"}]
